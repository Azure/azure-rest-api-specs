# Code Generation


## Swagger to SDK

This section describes what SDK should be generated by the automatic system.
This is not used by Autorest itself.

``` yaml $(swagger-to-sdk)
swagger-to-sdk:
  - repo: azure-sdk-for-net
  - repo: azure-sdk-for-go
  - repo: azure-sdk-for-node
  - repo: azure-sdk-for-js
  - repo: azure-sdk-for-ruby
    after_scripts:
      - bundle install && rake arm:regen_all_profiles['azure_mgmt_stream_analytics']
  - repo: azure-resource-manager-schemas
    after_scripts:
      - node sdkauto_afterscript.js streamanalytics/resource-manager
```


## C#

These settings apply only when `--csharp` is specified on the command line.
Please also specify `--csharp-sdks-folder=<path to "SDKs" directory of your azure-sdk-for-net clone>`.

``` yaml $(csharp)
csharp:
  azure-arm: true
  license-header: MICROSOFT_MIT_NO_VERSION
  namespace: Microsoft.Azure.Management.StreamAnalytics
  output-folder: $(csharp-sdks-folder)/streamanalytics/Microsoft.Azure.Management.StreamAnalytics/src/Generated
  clear-output-folder: true
```

## Go

See configuration in [readme.go.md](./readme.go.md)

## Java

These settings apply only when `--java` is specified on the command line.
Please also specify `--azure-libraries-for-java-folder=<path to the root directory of your azure-libraries-for-java clone>`.

``` yaml $(java)
azure-arm: true
fluent: true
namespace: com.microsoft.azure.management.streamanalytics
license-header: MICROSOFT_MIT_NO_CODEGEN
payload-flattening-threshold: 1
output-folder: $(azure-libraries-for-java-folder)/azure-mgmt-streamanalytics
```

### Java multi-api

``` yaml $(java) && $(multiapi)
batch:
  - tag: package-2016-03
```

### Tag: package-2016-03 and java

These settings apply only when `--tag=package-2016-03 --java` is specified on the command line.
Please also specify `--azure-libraries-for-java-folder=<path to the root directory of your azure-sdk-for-java clone>`.

``` yaml $(tag) == 'package-2016-03' && $(java) && $(multiapi)
java:
  namespace: com.microsoft.azure.management.streamanalytics.v2016_03_01
  output-folder: $(azure-libraries-for-java-folder)/sdk/streamanalytics/mgmt-v2016_03_01
regenerate-manager: true
generate-interface: true
```


# Suppression

``` yaml
directive:
  - suppress: R2020  # Model definition 'XXX' must have the properties 'name', 'id' and 'type' in its hierarchy and these properties must be marked as readonly.
    where: $.definitions.Input
    from: inputs.json
    reason: Need the “name” property to be writable on nested resources so that our RP can support a DEEP PUT scenario which at the time, ARM did not have a native way to support.

  - suppress: R2020  # Model definition 'XXX' must have the properties 'name', 'id' and 'type' in its hierarchy and these properties must be marked as readonly.
    where: $.definitions.Output
    from: outputs.json
    reason: Need the “name” property to be writable on nested resources so that our RP can support a DEEP PUT scenario which at the time, ARM did not have a native way to support.

  - suppress: R2020  # Model definition 'XXX' must have the properties 'name', 'id' and 'type' in its hierarchy and these properties must be marked as readonly.
    where: $.definitions.Transformation
    from: transformations.json
    reason: Need the “name” property to be writable on nested resources so that our RP can support a DEEP PUT scenario which at the time, ARM did not have a native way to support.

  - suppress: R2020  # Model definition 'XXX' must have the properties 'name', 'id' and 'type' in its hierarchy and these properties must be marked as readonly.
    where: $.definitions.Function
    from: functions.json
    reason: Need the “name” property to be writable on nested resources so that our RP can support a DEEP PUT scenario which at the time, ARM did not have a native way to support.

  - suppress: R2020  # Model definition 'XXX' must have the properties 'name', 'id' and 'type' in its hierarchy and these properties must be marked as readonly.
    where: $.definitions.SubscriptionQuota
    from: subscriptions.json
    reason: Need the “name” property to be writable on nested resources so that our RP can support a DEEP PUT scenario which at the time, ARM did not have a native way to support.
```

## AzureResourceSchema

See configuration in [readme.azureresourceschema.md](./readme.azureresourceschema.md)

## Multi-API/Profile support for AutoRest v3 generators 

AutoRest V3 generators require the use of `--tag=all-api-versions` to select api files.

This block is updated by an automatic script. Edits may be lost!

``` yaml $(tag) == 'all-api-versions' /* autogenerated */
# include the azure profile definitions from the standard location
require: $(this-folder)/../../../profiles/readme.md

# all the input files across all versions
input-file:
  - $(this-folder)/Microsoft.StreamAnalytics/stable/2016-03-01/streamingjobs.json
  - $(this-folder)/Microsoft.StreamAnalytics/stable/2016-03-01/inputs.json
  - $(this-folder)/Microsoft.StreamAnalytics/stable/2016-03-01/outputs.json
  - $(this-folder)/Microsoft.StreamAnalytics/stable/2016-03-01/transformations.json
  - $(this-folder)/Microsoft.StreamAnalytics/stable/2016-03-01/functions.json
  - $(this-folder)/Microsoft.StreamAnalytics/stable/2016-03-01/subscriptions.json

```

If there are files that should not be in the `all-api-versions` set, 
uncomment the  `exclude-file` section below and add the file paths.

``` yaml $(tag) == 'all-api-versions'
#exclude-file: 
#  - $(this-folder)/Microsoft.Example/stable/2010-01-01/somefile.json
```
