## Configuration

### Basic Information

These are the global settings for the API.

``` yaml
openapi-type: arm
tag: package-preview-2024-03
```

### Tag: package-preview-2024-03

These settings apply only when `--tag=package-preview-2024-03` is specified on the command line.

```yaml $(tag) == 'package-preview-2024-03'
input-file:
  - preview/2024-03-03-preview/avsAssessments.json
suppressions:
  - code: AvoidAdditionalProperties
    from: avsAssessments.json
    reason: The set of key-value pairs depend on the type of the workload and is not user-defined. Service uses this field to perform workload-specific validations and provide custom functionality based on the type of the workload.
    where:
      - $.definitions.AVSAssessmentOptionsProperties.properties.edges
  - code: OperationsAPIImplementation
    reason: Microsoft.Migrate resource provider has one RP with multiple SDKs. Operations API is centrally implemented at the AssessmentProjects level and intentionally excluded from individual service specifications to avoid duplication across multiple SDK instances.
```
