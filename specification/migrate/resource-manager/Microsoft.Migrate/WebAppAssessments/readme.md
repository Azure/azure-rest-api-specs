## Configuration

### Basic Information

These are the global settings for the API.

``` yaml
openapi-type: arm
tag: package-preview-2024-03
```

### Tag: package-preview-2024-03

These settings apply only when `--tag=package-preview-2024-03` is specified on the command line.

```yaml $(tag) == 'package-preview-2024-03'
input-file:
  - preview/2024-03-03-preview/webAppAssessments.json
suppressions:
  - code: AvoidAdditionalProperties
    where:
       - $.definitions.WepAppGraphAssessmentOptionsProperties.properties.edges
    reason: Edges is a dictionary type and needs additionalProperties
    from: webAppAssessments.json
  - code: OperationsAPIImplementation
    reason: Microsoft.Migrate resource provider has one RP with multiple SDKs. Operations API is centrally implemented at the AssessmentProjects level and intentionally excluded from individual service specifications to avoid duplication across multiple SDK instances.
```
