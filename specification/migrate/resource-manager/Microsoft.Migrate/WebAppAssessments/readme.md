```

### Tag: package-preview-2024-03

These settings apply only when `--tag=package-preview-2024-03` is specified on the command line.

```yaml $(tag) == 'package-preview-2024-03'
input-file:
  - preview/2024-03-03-preview/webAppAssessments.json
suppressions:
  - code: AvoidAdditionalProperties
    where: $.definitions.WebAppExtendedDetails.properties.sites
    reason: Dictionary is used for web app mappings in web app assessments.
  - code: OperationsAPIImplementation
    reason: Microsoft.Migrate resource provider has one RP with multiple SDKs. Operations API is centrally implemented at the AssessmentProjects level and intentionally excluded from individual service specifications to avoid duplication across multiple SDK instances.
