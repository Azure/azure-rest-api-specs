                        the model, you might consider using the `output_text` property where

                      - The length and order of items in the `output` array is dependent
                        on the model's response.
                      - Rather than accessing the first item in the `output` array and
                        assuming it's an `assistant` message with the content generated by
                        the model, you might consider using the `output_text` property where
                        supported in SDKs.

                      When using along with `previous_response_id`, the instructions from a previous
                      response will not be carried over to the next response. This makes it simple
                      to swap out system (or developer) messages in new responses.

        1. discovery://storages/<storageArmId>/paths/<path> to reference data on Discovery Storage.
        2. discovery://storageassets/<storageAssetArmId> to reference a Discovery Storage Asset.
        3. discovery://storageassets/<storageAssetArmId>/paths/<path> to reference a subpath within a Discovery Storage Asset.

        Note that in the discovery://storages/<storageArmId>/paths/<path>, the <path> is not an absolute path within
        the underlying NFS volume. Rather, the service creates a subdirectory on each storage for storing job
        artifacts, and the <path> is relative to that subdirectory. The location of the subdirectory is not published,
        nor is it guaranteed to be stable over time, but we do guarantee that a given discovery://storages/ URI will
        always point to the same logical data. We do not expect API consumers to build these URIs from scratch,
        but to use the output URI (or a subpath of it) from an earlier API call as the input to a later API call.

        The default format is `{ "type": "text" }` with no additional options.

        **Not recommended for gpt-4o and newer models:**

        Setting to `{ "type": "json_object" }` enables the older JSON mode, which
        ensures the message the model generates is valid JSON. Using `json_schema`
        is preferred for models that support it.

        * If set to 'default', then the request will be processed with the standard
        pricing and performance for the selected model.

          description: |-
            Command to pass to tool container entrypoint.

            If the tool has multiple containers defined, this command is executed on all of them.

            If omitted, all containers execute their raw entrypoints.

            This command is parsed into an argument list which is passed to the underlying container runtime.
            For example, if the command is "python /code/wrapper.py --input /inputs/abcdef-input-1/input.txt --output /outputs/abcdef-output-1",
            then the container runtime will receive the following argument list:
            ["python", "/code/wrapper.py", "--input", "/inputs/abcdef-input-1/input.txt", "--output", "/outputs/abcdef-output-1"]

            The container's entrypoint is not overridden. In Docker terminology, the above argument list becomes
            the CMD, not the ENTRYPOINT of the launched container.

            Our parsing includes the following limited interpretation of special characters:
            - The only special characters are " ' and \.
            - Backslashes `\` escape the next character if that character is a special character, preserving its literal value.
            - Double quotes `"` preserve everything inside them literally, with the exception of the characters " and \, which must be escaped with a backslash `\`. Unmatched quotes will throw an error.
            - Single quotes `'` preserve everything inside them literally. A single-quote cannot occur within single-quotes. Unmatched quotes will throw an error.

            If you wish to run a command that relies on shell features such as globbing or output redirection, you either need to:
            - use a container with an entrypoint that is a shell (e.g. `/bin/sh` or `/bin/bash`) and pass a command which is valid for that shell e.g.
            `-c 'python /code/wrapper.py --input /inputs/abcdef-input-1/* --output /outputs/abcdef-output-1'`
            - use a container which has a shell installed, and include the shell in the command, e.g.
            `sh -c "python /code/wrapper.py --input /inputs/abcdef-input-1/* --output /outputs/abcdef-output-1"`

            Output data URIs.

            This array will contain the same set of mountPaths specified in the outputData property of initial tool run request,
            but every mountPath will have a corresponding URI that points to the location where the output data was persisted:
            * for mount paths which had a URI specified in the outputData property, the URI will be the same as the one
            specified in the request, and the data will have been persisted to the location specified by that URI.
            * for mount paths which did not have a URI specified in the outputData property, the URI will point to a
            folder created by the service on the Storage specified by the storageId property in the tool run request.

            E.g. if the following run request is made:
            ```json
            {
              "toolId": "testTool",
              "command": "echo 'hello world' > /output1/hello.txt",
              "inlineFiles": [],
              "inputData": [],
              "outputData": [
                  {
                      "mountPath": "/output1"
                  }
              ],
              "nodePoolIds": ["<nodePoolId>"],
              "storageId": "<storageARMId"
            }
            ```
            then once the tool completes, the status API response will contain the following:
            ```json
            {
              "status": "Succeeded",
              ...
              "outputData": [
                 {
                   "uri": "discovery://storages/<storageARMId>/paths/<some-generated-path>/output1",
                   "mountPath": "/output1"
                 }
              ]
            }
            ```
            `discovery://storages/<storageARMId>/paths/<some-generated-path>/output1` can then be used as an
            input to another tool run. Any valid subpaths can also be used, e.g.
            `discovery://storages/<storageARMId>/paths/<some-generated-path>/output1/hello.txt` to refer specifically
            to the hello.txt file.
