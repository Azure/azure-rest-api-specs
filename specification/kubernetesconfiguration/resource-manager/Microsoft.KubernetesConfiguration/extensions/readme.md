> see https://aka.ms/autorest

This is the AutoRest configuration file for KubernetesConfiguration Extensions.

## Getting Started

To build the SDKs for KubernetesConfiguration extensions, simply install AutoRest via `npm` (`npm install -g autorest`) and then run:

> `autorest readme.md`

To see additional help and options, run:

> `autorest --help`

## Configuration

### Basic Information

These are the global settings for the KubernetesConfiguration.

``` yaml
title: ExtensionsClient
description: KubernetesConfiguration Extensions Client
openapi-type: arm
tag: package-2024-11
```

---

### Tag: package-2024-11

These settings apply only when `--tag=package-2024-11` is specified on the command line.

``` yaml $(tag) == 'package-2024-11'
input-file:
  - stable/2024-11-01/extensions.json
suppressions:
  - code: OperationsAPIImplementation
    from: extensions.json
    reason: Operations API is implemented as a separate service.
  - code: ResourceNameRestriction
    from: extensions.json
    reason: Existing service contract needs to be backward compatible, pattern validation exists in RP.
  - code: DeleteResponseCodes
    from: extensions.json
    reason: Existing service contract needs to be backward compatible, force delete does synchronous delete and returns 200.
  - code: LroLocationHeader
    from: extensions.json
    reason: Existing service contract needs to be backward compatible, 202 operations return Azure-Async-Operation header.
  - code: PatchIdentityProperty
    from: extensions.json
    reason: Existing service contract needs to be backward compatible, service does not use/allow identity.
  - code: AvoidAdditionalProperties
    from: extensions.json
    reason: Existing service contract needs to be backward compatible.
  - code: PatchResponseCodes
    from: extensions.json
    reason: Existing service contract needs to be backward compatible.  
  - code: PatchBodyParametersSchema
    from: extensions.json
    reason: Existing service contract needs to be backward compatible.  
```

# Code Generation

## Swagger to SDK

This section describes what SDK should be generated by the automatic system.
This is not used by Autorest itself.

``` yaml $(swagger-to-sdk)
swagger-to-sdk:
  - repo: azure-sdk-for-python
  - repo: azure-sdk-for-java
  - repo: azure-sdk-for-go
  - repo: azure-sdk-for-js
  - repo: azure-sdk-for-ruby
    after_scripts:
      - bundle install && rake arm:regen_all_profiles['azure_mgmt_kubernetesconfiguration']
  - repo: azure-resource-manager-schemas
  - repo: azure-powershell
```
