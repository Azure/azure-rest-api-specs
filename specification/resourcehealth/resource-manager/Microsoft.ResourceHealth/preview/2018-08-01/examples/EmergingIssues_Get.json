Engineers determined that during this issue, the control plane service became unhealthy after receiving a significant increase in internally generated operations and reaching an operational threshold. This led to service management requests becoming unable to complete, which in-turn resulted in timeouts and throttling. Subsequent investigation by engineers determined this issue was due service requests from an internal Azure group that triggered a bug which caused an excessive number of internally generated operations.",
