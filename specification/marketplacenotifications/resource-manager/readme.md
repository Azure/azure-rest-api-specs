## Configuration

### Basic Information

These are the global settings for the Marketplace notifications API.

``` yaml
openapi-type: arm
tag: package-2021-03-03
```
### Composite packages

The following packages may be composed from multiple api-versions.

### Tag: package-composite-v1

These settings apply only when `--tag=package-composite-v1` is specified on the command line.

This section contains the "composite-v1" set of APIs, which is composed from a selection of api-versions that will remain backwards compatible with "v1" clients.

APIs must only be added to this section when the API is publicly available in at least 1 production region and at least 1 generated client has been tested end-to-end.

``` yaml $(tag) == 'package-composite-v1'
input-file:
- Microsoft.MarketplaceNotifications/stable/2021-03-03/MarketplaceNotifications.json

# Needed when there is more than one input file
override-info:
  title: MarketplaceManagementClient
```

### Tag: package-2021-03-03

These settings apply only when `--tag=package-2021-03-03` is specified on the command line.

``` yaml $(tag) == 'package-2021-03-03'
input-file:
  - Microsoft.MarketplaceNotifications/stable/2021-03-03/MarketplaceNotifications.json
```

# Code Generation

## Swagger to SDK

This section describes what SDK should be generated by the automatic system.
This is not used by Autorest itself.

``` yaml $(swagger-to-sdk)
swagger-to-sdk:
  - repo: azure-sdk-for-net
  - repo: azure-resource-manager-schemas
    after_scripts:
      - node sdkauto_afterscript.js marketplacenotifications/resource-manager
  - repo: azure-powershell
```

## C#

These settings apply only when `--csharp` is specified on the command line.
Please also specify `--csharp-sdks-folder=<path to "SDKs" directory of your azure-sdk-for-net clone>`.

``` yaml $(csharp)
csharp:
  azure-arm: true
  license-header: MICROSOFT_MIT_NO_VERSION
  namespace: Microsoft.Azure.Management.MarketplaceNotifications
  output-folder: $(csharp-sdks-folder)/marketplacenotifications/Microsoft.Azure.Management.MarketplaceNotifications/src/Generated
  clear-output-folder: true
  modelerfour:
    lenient-model-deduplication: true
```
