Configuring health checks makes sense only in the following configurations:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <b>Non-alias resource record sets</b>: You're checking the health of a group of non-alias resource record sets that have the same routing policy, name, and type (such as multiple weighted records named www.example.com with a type of A) and you specify health check IDs for all the resource record sets. </p> <p>If the health check status for a resource record set is healthy, Route 53 includes the record among the records that it responds to DNS queries with.</p> <p>If the health check status for a resource record set is unhealthy, Route 53 stops responding to DNS queries using the value for that resource record set.</p> <p>If the health check status for all resource record sets in the group is unhealthy, Route 53 considers all resource record sets in the group healthy and responds to DNS queries accordingly. </p> </li> <li> <p> <b>Alias resource record sets</b>: You specify the following settings:</p> <ul> <li> <p>You set <code>EvaluateTargetHealth</code> to true for an alias resource record set in a group of resource record sets that have the same routing policy, name, and type (such as multiple weighted records named www.example.com with a type of A). </p> </li> <li> <p>You configure the alias resource record set to route traffic to a non-alias resource record set in the same hosted zone.</p> </li> <li> <p>You specify a health check ID for the non-alias resource record set. </p> </li> </ul> <p>If the health check status is healthy, Route 53 considers the alias resource record set to be healthy and includes the alias record among the records that it responds to DNS queries with.</p> <p>If the health check status is unhealthy, Route 53 stops responding to DNS queries using the alias resource record set.</p> <note> <p>The alias resource record set can also route traffic to a <i>group</i> of non-alias resource record sets that have the same routing policy, name, and type. In that configuration, associate health checks with all of the resource record sets in the group of non-alias resource record sets.</p> </note> </li> </ul> <p> <b>Geolocation Routing</b> </p> <p>For geolocation resource record sets, if an endpoint is unhealthy, Route 53 looks for a resource record set for the larger, associated geographic region. For example, suppose you have resource record sets for a state in the United States, for the entire United States, for North America, and a resource record set that has <code>*</code> for <code>CountryCode</code> is <code>*</code>, which applies to all locations. If the endpoint for the state resource record set is unhealthy, Route 53 checks for healthy resource record sets in the following order until it finds a resource record set for which the endpoint is healthy:</p> <ul> <li> <p>The United States</p> </li> <li> <p>North America</p> </li> <li> <p>The default resource record set</p> </li> </ul> <p> <b>Specifying the Health Check Endpoint by Domain Name</b> </p> <p>If your health checks specify the endpoint only by domain name, we recommend that you create a separate health check for each endpoint. For example, create a health check for each <code>HTTP</code> server that is serving content for <code>www.example.com</code>. For the value of <code>FullyQualifiedDomainName</code>, specify the domain name of the server (such as <code>us-east-2-www.example.com</code>), not the name of the resource record sets (<code>www.example.com</code>).</p> <important> <p>Health check results will be unpredictable if you do the following:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Create a health check that has the same value for <code>FullyQualifiedDomainName</code> as the name of a resource record set.</p> </li> <li> <p>Associate that health check with the resource record set.</p> </li> </ul> </important>")
