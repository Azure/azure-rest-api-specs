### Tag: package-2021-04-01-only

These settings apply only when `--tag=package-2021-04-01-only` is specified on the command line.

```yaml $(tag) == 'package-2021-04-01-only'
input-file:

- Microsoft.SecurityInsights/stable/2021-04-01/operations.json
- Microsoft.SecurityInsights/stable/2021-04-01/Watchlists.json
directive:
  - suppress: R4017
    from: Microsoft.SecurityInsights/stable/2021-04-01/Incidents.json
    where: $.definitions.Incidents
    reason: The Incident does not support list by subscription. It's not a top-level resource. To get the Incident, we should have a subscription as well as a resource group and Log Analytics workspace.
  - suppress: R4017
    from: Microsoft.SecurityInsights/stable/2021-04-01/Watchlists.json
    where: $.definitions.Watchlist
