## Configuration

### Basic Information

These are the global settings for the SecurityInsights API.

```yaml
openapi-type: arm
tag: package-composite-v1
```

### Tag: package-composite-v1

These settings apply only when `--tag=package-composite-v1` is specified on the command line.

```yaml $(tag) == 'package-composite-v1'
input-file:
- Microsoft.SecurityInsights/stable/2020-01-01/SecurityInsights.json
directive:
  - suppress: R2059
    from: Microsoft.SecurityInsights/stable/2020-01-01/SecurityInsights.json
    reason: it's not actually a resource path; the validator is confused because the LogAnalytics namespace is in the URI path.
    approved-by: "@lirenhe"
```

### Tag: package-2021-03-preview-only

These settings apply only when `--tag=package-2021-03-preview-only` is specified on the command line.

```yaml $(tag) == 'package-2021-03-preview-only'
input-file:
- Microsoft.SecurityInsights/preview/2021-03-01-preview/Settings.json
- Microsoft.SecurityInsights/preview/2021-03-01-preview/operations.json
directive:
  - suppress: R4017
    from: Microsoft.SecurityInsights/preview/2021-03-01-preview/Settings.json
    where: $.definitions.Settings
    reason: The Setting does not support list by subscription. It's not a top-level resource. To get the Watchlist, we should have a subscription as well as a resource group and Log Analytics workspace. 
```

### Tag: package-2019-01-preview-only

These settings apply only when `--tag=package-2019-01-preview-only` is specified on the command line.

directive:
  - suppress: R4017
    from: Microsoft.SecurityInsights/preview/2019-01-01-preview/SecurityInsights.json
    where: $.definitions.ThreatIntelligenceResource
    reason: Our API is designed based on per region per workspace concept. There is no use case of our customers to get all indicators in multiple workspaces.
    approved-by: "@cheggert"
  - suppress: R4017
    from: Microsoft.SecurityInsights/preview/2019-01-01-preview/SecurityInsights.json
    where: $.definitions.Watchlist
    reason: The Watchlist does not support list by subscription. It's not a top-level resource. To get the Watchlist, we should have a subscription as well as a resource group and Log Analytics workspace. 
  - suppress: R4017
    from: Microsoft.SecurityInsights/preview/2019-01-01-preview/SecurityInsights.json
    where: $.definitions.AutomationRule
    reason: The AutomationRule does not support list by subscription. It's not a top-level resource. To get the AutomationRule, we should have a subscription as well as a resource group and Log Analytics workspace.
