## Suppressions

```yaml
suppressions:
  - code: AvoidAdditionalProperties
    from: azuredatatransfer.json
    where: $.definitions.ReadPipelineConnection
    reason:
      This is due to the migration to make use of [lifecycle visibility transforms](https://typespec.io/docs/language-basics/visibility/#lifecycle-visibility-transforms)
      typespec (which changed the name), the old OpenAPI v2 JSON spec had this property already in the original model.
      This is required as the Pipeline and Connection that this references exist across ARM Subscription(s) and Entra Id
      Tenant boundaries. This metadata is meant to be readOnly and exposed as information to a user. i.e.
      This connection exists as in tenant id 11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111.
  - code: AvoidAdditionalProperties
    from: azuredatatransfer.json
    where: $.definitions.ReadReadPipelineConnectionProperties
    reason:
      This was inherited from a new model being created in typespec, the old OpenAPI v2 JSON spec had this
      property in the original model (just it was an inline model). This is required as the Pipeline and Connection
      that this references exist across ARM Subscription and Entra Id Tenant boundaries. This metadata is meant to be
      readOnly and exposed as information to a user. i.e. This connection exists as in tenant id
      11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111.
  - code: AvoidAdditionalProperties
    from: azuredatatransfer.json
    where: $.definitions.ReadReadInternalMetadataProperties
    reason:
      This is due to the migration to make use of [lifecycle visibility transforms](https://typespec.io/docs/language-basics/visibility/#lifecycle-visibility-transforms)
      typespec (which changed the name), the old OpenAPI v2 JSON spec had this property already in the original model.
