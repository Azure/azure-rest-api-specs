## Configuration

### Basic Information

These are the global settings for the playwrighttesting.

```yaml
title: PlaywrightTestingClient
description: Azure Playwright testing management service
openapi-type: arm
openapi-subtype: rpaas
tag: package-2024-02-01-preview
```

### Tag: package-2024-02-01-preview

These settings apply only when `--tag=package-2024-02-01-preview` is specified on the command line.

```yaml $(tag) == 'package-2024-02-01-preview'
input-file:
  - Microsoft.AzurePlaywrightService/preview/2024-02-01-preview/playwrighttesting.json
suppressions:
  - code: ResourceNameRestriction
    from: playwrighttesting.json
    reason: We have enums defined for quota resource names which doesn't support string pattern validation.
  - code: ProvisioningStateMustBeReadOnly
    from: playwrighttesting.json
    reason: Seems like a tool bug, as the visibility is set to read only in the TypeSpec already.
  - code: DeleteResponseCodes
    from: playwrighttesting.json
    reason: Seems like a tool bug, as default operations with codes are generated from the TrackedResourceOperations in the TypeSpec.
    where:
      - $.paths["/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.AzurePlaywrightService/accounts/{accountName}"].delete
```

``` yaml
modelerfour:
  flatten-models: false
```

### Tag: package-2023-10-01-preview

These settings apply only when `--tag=package-2023-10-01-preview` is specified on the command line.

```yaml $(tag) == 'package-2023-10-01-preview'
input-file:
  - Microsoft.AzurePlaywrightService/preview/2023-10-01-preview/playwrighttesting.json
```
