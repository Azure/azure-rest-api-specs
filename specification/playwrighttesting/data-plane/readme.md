## Configuration

### Basic Information

These are the global settings for the playwrighttesting.

```yaml
openapi-type: data-plane
tag: package-2024-12-01
title: PlaywrightTestingClient
security: AADToken
#security-scopes: [[SecurityScopes]]
```

### Tag: package-2024-12-01

These settings apply only when `--tag=package-2024-12-01` is specified on the command line.

```yaml $(tag) == 'package-2024-12-01'
input-file:
  - Microsoft.PlaywrightTesting.AuthManager/stable/2024-12-01/playwrighttesting.json
suppressions:
  - code: ValidResponseCodeRequired
    from: playwrighttesting.json
    reason: Need 302 response code as a product requirement to redirect the client for test execution on remote browsers provided by the service.
    where:
      - $.paths["/accounts/{accountId}/browsers"].get.responses
  - code: SecurityDefinitionDescription
    from: playwrighttesting.json
    reason: Seems like a tool bug, as the description is added in the TypeSpec already.
  - code: PathParameterSchema
    from: playwrighttesting.json
    reason: No provision to define path parameter schema for custom routes of rpc operations in Typespec.
    where:
      - $.paths["/accounts/{accountId}/browsers"].get.parameters[1]
  - code: OperationId
    from: playwrighttesting.json
    reason: Inconsistency with Typespec nomenclature to use create and replace for put while update is used for patch api.
    where:
      - $.paths["/accounts/{accountId}/access-tokens/{accessTokenId}"].put.operationId
```

### Tag: package-2023-10-01-preview

These settings apply only when `--tag=package-2023-10-01-preview` is specified on the command line.

```yaml $(tag) == 'package-2023-10-01-preview'
input-file:
  - Microsoft.PlaywrightTesting.AuthManager\preview\2023-10-01-preview\playwrighttesting.json
```

# Code Generation

## Swagger to SDK

This section describes what SDK should be generated by the automatic system.
This is not used by Autorest itself.

```yaml $(swagger-to-sdk)
swagger-to-sdk:
  - repo: azure-sdk-for-js
  - repo: azure-sdk-for-python
  - repo: azure-sdk-for-java
  - repo: azure-sdk-for-net
