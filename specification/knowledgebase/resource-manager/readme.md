# VisualStudio

> see https://aka.ms/autorest

This is the AutoRest configuration file for KnowledgeBase.


The App service RP comprises of services where each service has its own tag.
Hence, each sub-service has its own swagger spec.

All of them are tied together using this configuration and are packaged together into one compute client library.
This makes it easier for customers to download one (NuGet/npm/pip/maven/gem) compute client library package rather than installing individual packages for each sub service.

## Configuration



### Basic Information
These are the global settings for the Knowledgebase API.

``` yaml
openapi-type: arm
tag: package-2019-11-01-preview
```


### Tag: package-2019-11-01-preview

These settings apply only when `--tag=package-2019-11-01-preview` is specified on the command line.

``` yaml $(tag) == 'package-2019-11-01-preview'
input-file:
- Microsoft.KnowledgeBase/preview/2019-11-01-preview/knowledgebase.json
```

## Code Generation


## Swagger to SDK

This section describes what SDK should be generated by the automatic system.
This is not used by Autorest itself.

``` yaml $(swagger-to-sdk)
swagger-to-sdk:
  - repo: azure-sdk-for-go
  - repo: azure-sdk-for-node
  - repo: azure-sdk-for-js
  - repo: azure-sdk-for-net
```
