fatal   | Internal error in AutoRest.CSharp
   Please file an issue at https://github.com/Azure/autorest.csharp/issues/new. 
   Attach the written 'Configuration.json' and 'CodeModel.yaml' or the original swagger so we can reproduce your error.

Exception: The blobDuration property of MetricAvailability ends with "Duration" but does not use the duration format to be generated as TimeSpan type. Add "format": "duration" with directive in autorest.md for the property if it's ISO 8601 format like P1DT2H59M59S. Add "x-ms-format": "duration-constant" if it's the constant format like 1.2:59:59.5000000. If the property does not conform to a TimeSpan format, please use "x-ms-client-name" to rename the property for the client.
