# Web

> see https://aka.ms/autorest

This is the AutoRest configuration file for Web.


The App service RP comprises of services where each service has its own tag.
Hence, each sub-service has its own swagger spec.

All of them are tied together using this configuration and are packaged together into one compute client library.
This makes it easier for customers to download one (NuGet/npm/pip/maven/gem) compute client library package rather than installing individual packages for each sub service.


---
## Getting Started
To build the SDK for Web, simply [Install AutoRest](https://aka.ms/autorest/install) and in this folder, run:

> `autorest`

To see additional help and options, run:

> `autorest --help`

## Configuration



### Basic Information
These are the global settings for the Web API.

``` yaml
title: WebSiteManagementClient
description: WebSite Management Client
openapi-type: arm
tag: package-2020-10
```

### Suppression

``` yaml
directive:
  - suppress: XmsResourceInPutResponse
    from: WebApps.json
    where: $.paths["/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.Web/sites/{name}/functions/{functionName}/keys/{keyName}"].put
    reason: Model type is not an Azure resource
  - suppress: RequiredPropertiesMissingInResourceModel
    from: WebApps.json
    where: $.definitions.KeyInfo
    reason: Model type is not an Azure resource
  - suppress: BodyTopLevelProperties
    from: WebApps.json
    where: $.definitions.KeyInfo.properties

```

This section describes what SDK should be generated by the automatic system.
This is not used by Autorest itself.

``` yaml $(swagger-to-sdk)
swagger-to-sdk:
  - repo: azure-sdk-for-net
  - repo: azure-sdk-for-python
    autorest_options:
      use: "@microsoft.azure/autorest.python@4.0.70"
    after_scripts:
      - python ./scripts/multiapi_init_gen.py azure-mgmt-web
      - python ./scripts/trim_aio.py ./sdk/appservice/azure-mgmt-web
  - repo: azure-sdk-for-python-track2
  - repo: azure-sdk-for-java
  - repo: azure-sdk-for-go
  - repo: azure-sdk-for-node
  - repo: azure-sdk-for-js
  - repo: azure-sdk-for-ruby
    after_scripts:
      - bundle install && rake arm:regen_all_profiles['azure_mgmt_web']
  - repo: azure-resource-manager-schemas
    after_scripts:
