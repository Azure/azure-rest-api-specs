```

### Tag: package-2021-07-01-preview

These settings apply only when `--tag=package-2021-07-01-preview` is specified on the command line.

modelerfour:
  lenient-model-deduplication: true
```

# Code Generation

## Suppression

``` yaml
directive:
  - suppress: D5001
where:
  - $.paths["/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/xxx.get
reason: It doesn't support file annotation in example file.
```

## Swagger to SDK

This section describes what SDK should be generated by the automatic system.
This is not used by Autorest itself.

``` yaml $(swagger-to-sdk)
swagger-to-sdk:
  - repo: azure-sdk-for-net
```
