## Configuration

### Basic Information

These are the global settings for the Azure Purview Devops Policies API.

``` yaml
openapi-type: data-plane
tag: package-2022-11-01-preview
```

### Tag: package-2022-11-01-preview

These settings apply only when `--tag=package-2022-11-01-preview` is specified on the command line.

``` yaml $(tag) == 'package-2022-11-01-preview'
input-file:
  - preview/2022-11-01-preview/purviewDevopsPolicy.json
```

## Suppression

``` yaml
directive:
  - suppress: D5001
where:
  - $.paths["/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/xxx.get
reason: It doesn't support file annotation in example file.
```

# Code Generation

## Swagger to SDK

This section describes what SDK should be generated by the automatic system.
This is not used by Autorest itself.

``` yaml $(swagger-to-sdk)
swagger-to-sdk:
  - repo: azure-sdk-for-net
```
