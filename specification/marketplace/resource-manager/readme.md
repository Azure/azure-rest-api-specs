---

## Configuration

### Basic Information

Make an HTTPs request from Ibiza to the endpoint in order to get the check if user is private or not


### Tag: package-2019-12-01

These settings apply only when `--tag=package-2019-12-01` is specified on the command line.

```yaml $(tag) == 'package-2019-12-01'
input-file:
  - Microsoft.Marketplace/stable/2019-12-01/Marketplace.json
```
## Multi-API/Profile support for AutoRest v3 generators 

AutoRest V3 generators require the use of `--tag=all-api-versions` to select api files.

This block is updated by an automatic script. Edits may be lost!

``` yaml $(tag) == 'all-api-versions' /* autogenerated */
# include the azure profile definitions from the standard location
require: $(this-folder)/../../../profiles/readme.md

# all the input files across all versions
input-file:
  - $(this-folder)/Microsoft.Marketplace/stable/2019-12-01/Marketplace.json

```

If there are files that should not be in the `all-api-versions` set, 
uncomment the  `exclude-file` section below and add the file paths.

``` yaml $(tag) == 'all-api-versions'
#exclude-file: 
#  - $(this-folder)/Microsoft.Example/stable/2010-01-01/somefile.json
```
