    reason: We don not yet support systemdata
  - suppress: R3016
    from: botservice.json

# Code Generation

## Swagger to SDK

This section describes what SDK should be generated by the automatic system.
This is not used by Autorest itself.

``` yaml $(swagger-to-sdk)
swagger-to-sdk:
  - repo: azure-sdk-for-net
  - repo: azure-sdk-for-python
  - repo: azure-sdk-for-go
  - repo: azure-resource-manager-schemas
    after_scripts:
      - node sdkauto_afterscript.js botservice/resource-manager
  - repo: azure-sdk-for-js
```


## Suppression
```
directive:
  - suppress: SECRET_PROPERTY
    from: botservice.json
    where: $.definitions.FacebookChannelProperties.properties.verifyToken
    reason: We do need to return verifyToken in FacebookChannelProperties.
```


## C#

These settings apply only when `--csharp` is specified on the command line.
Please also specify `--csharp-sdks-folder=<path to "SDKs" directory of your azure-sdk-for-net clone>`.

``` yaml $(csharp)
csharp:
  azure-arm: true
  license-header: MICROSOFT_MIT_NO_VERSION
  namespace: Microsoft.Azure.Management.BotService
  output-folder: $(csharp-sdks-folder)/botservice/Microsoft.Azure.Management.BotService/src/Generated
  clear-output-folder: true
```
