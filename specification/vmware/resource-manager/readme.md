## Configuration

### Basic Information
These are the global settings for the VMware Solution API.

``` yaml
openapi-type: arm
tag: package-2019-08-09-preview
```

### Tag: package-2019-08-09-preview

These settings apply only when `--tag=package-2019-08-09-preview` is specified on the command line.

``` yaml $(tag) == 'package-2019-08-09-preview'
input-file:
- Microsoft.AVS/preview/2019-08-09-preview/vmware.json
directive:
  - suppress: R3020
    from: vmware.json
    reason: Microsoft.AVS was chosen over Microsoft.AzureVMwareSolution
  - suppress: R3010
    from: vmware.json
    reason: list by immediate parent operations are defined
  - suppress: R2001
    from: vmware.json
    reason: x-ms-client-flatten will be used in next API version
```
