    "description": "The Azure Maps Elevation API provides an HTTP interface to query elevation data on the  surface of the Earth. Elevation data can be retrieved at specific locations by sending  lat/lon coordinates, by defining an ordered set of vertices that form a Polyline and a  number of sample points along the length of a Polyline, or by defining a bounding box  that consists of equally spaced vertices as rows and columns. The vertical datum is EPSG:3855.  This datum uses the EGM2008 geoid model applied to the WGS84 ellipsoid as its zero height  reference surface. The vertical unit is measured in meters, the spatial resolution of the  elevation data is 0.8 arc-second for global coverage (~24 meters)."

When paired with [Azure role-based access](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/overview) control it can be used to control access to Azure Maps REST APIs. Azure role-based access controls are used to designate access to one or more Azure Maps resource account or sub-resources. Any user, group, or service principal can be granted access via a  built-in role or a custom role composed of one or more permissions to Azure Maps REST APIs.\n\nTo implement scenarios, we recommend viewing [authentication concepts](https://aka.ms/amauth). In summary, this security definition provides a solution for modeling application(s) via objects capable of access control on specific APIs and scopes.\n\n#### Notes\n* This security definition **requires** the use of the `x-ms-client-id` header to indicate which Azure Maps resource the application is requesting access to. This can be acquired from the [Maps management API](https://aka.ms/amauthdetails).\n* \nThe `Authorization URL` is specific to the Azure public cloud instance. Sovereign clouds have unique Authorization URLs and Azure Active directory configurations. \n* \nThe Azure role-based access control is configured from the [Azure management plane](https://aka.ms/amrbac) via Azure portal, PowerShell, CLI, Azure SDKs, or REST APIs.\n* \nUsage of the [Azure Maps Web SDK](https://aka.ms/amaadmc) allows for configuration based setup of an application for multiple use cases.\n* Currently, Azure Active Directory [v1.0 or v2.0](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/azure-ad-endpoint-comparison) supports Work, School, and Guests but does not support Personal accounts.",
