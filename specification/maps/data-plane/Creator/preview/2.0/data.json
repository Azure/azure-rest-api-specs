When paired with [Azure role-based access](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/overview) control it can be used to control access to Azure Maps REST APIs. Azure role-based access controls are used to designate access to one or more Azure Maps resource account or sub-resources. Any user, group, or service principal can be granted access via a  built-in role or a custom role composed of one or more permissions to Azure Maps REST APIs.\n\nTo implement scenarios, we recommend viewing [authentication concepts](https://aka.ms/amauth). In summary, this security definition provides a solution for modeling application(s) via objects capable of access control on specific APIs and scopes.\n\n#### Notes\n* This security definition **requires** the use of the `x-ms-client-id` header to indicate which Azure Maps resource the application is requesting access to. This can be acquired from the [Maps management API](https://aka.ms/amauthdetails).\n* \nThe `Authorization URL` is specific to the Azure public cloud instance. Sovereign clouds have unique Authorization URLs and Azure Active directory configurations. \n* \nThe Azure role-based access control is configured from the [Azure management plane](https://aka.ms/amrbac) via Azure portal, PowerShell, CLI, Azure SDKs, or REST APIs.\n* \nUsage of the [Azure Maps Web SDK](https://aka.ms/amaadmc) allows for configuration based setup of an application for multiple use cases.\n* For more information on Microsoft identity platform, see [Microsoft identity platform overview](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity-platform/v2-overview).",

See the [Preview Supplemental Terms](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/) for additional details.\n## Submit Update Request\n\nTo update your content you will use a `PUT` request. The request body will contain the new data that will replace \nthe existing data. The `Content-Type` header will be set to the content type of the data, and the path will contain \nthe `udid` of the data to be update.\n\nFor example, to update a collection of geofences that were previously uploaded using the Upload API, place the new \ngeofence content in the request body. Set the `udid` parameter in the path to the `udid` of the data received \npreviously in the upload API response. And set the `Content-Type` header to one of the following media types:\n\n- `application/json`\n- `application/vnd.geo+json`\n- `application/octet-stream`\n\nHere's a sample request body for updating a simple Geofence. It's represented as a circle geometry using a center \npoint and a radius. The sample below is in `GeoJSON`:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"type\": \"FeatureCollection\",\n    \"features\": [{\n        \"type\": \"Feature\",\n        \"geometry\": {\n            \"type\": \"Point\",\n            \"coordinates\": [-122.126986, 47.639754]\n        },\n        \"properties\": {\n            \"geometryId\": \"001\",\n            \"radius\": 500\n        }\n    }]\n}\n```\n\nThe previously uploaded geofence had a radius of 100m. The above request will update it to 500m.\n\nThe Data Update API performs a \nlong-running operation.\n\n## Data Update Limits\n\nPlease, be aware that currently every Azure Maps account has a [data storage limit](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/azure-subscription-service-limits#azure-maps-limits). \nOnce the storage limit is reached, all the new upload API calls will return a `409 Conflict` http error response. \nYou can always use the [Data Delete API](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/maps/data-v2/delete) to \ndelete old/unused content and create space for new uploads.",

Optionally, you can also pass in an `Accept` header to specify a preference for the `Content-Type` of the data response. <br>\nFor example, to download a collection of geofences previously uploaded using the Upload API, set the `udid` parameter in the path to the `udid` of the data received previously in the upload API response and set the `Accept` header to either one of the following media types: \n    \n  - `application/json`\n  - `application/vnd.geo+json`\n  - `application/octet-stream`\n\n\n### Download Data Response\n\nThe Download API will return a HTTP `200 OK` response if the data resource with the passed-in `udid` is found, where the response body will contain the content of the data resource.<br>\nA HTTP `400 Bad Request` error response will be returned if the data resource with the passed-in `udid` is not found.<br>\n\nHere's a sample response body for a simple geofence represented in `GeoJSON` uploaded previously using the Upload API:\n<br>\n\n```json\n{\n    \"type\": \"FeatureCollection\",\n    \"features\": [{\n        \"type\": \"Feature\",\n        \"geometry\": {\n            \"type\": \"Point\",\n            \"coordinates\": [-122.126986, 47.639754]\n        },\n        \"properties\": {\n            \"geometryId\": \"001\",\n            \"radius\": 500\n        }\n    }]\n}\n```",
