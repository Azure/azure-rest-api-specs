## Configuration

### Basic Information

These are the global settings for Creator Client.

``` yaml
title: CreatorClient
openapi-type: data-plane
tag: 2.0-preview
# at some point those credentials will move away to Swagger according to [this](https://github.com/Azure/autorest/issues/3718)
add-credentials: true
credential-default-policy-type: BearerTokenCredentialPolicy
credential-scopes: https://atlas.microsoft.com/.default
```


### Tag: 2.0-preview

These settings apply only when `--tag=2.0-preview` is specified on the command line.

``` yaml $(tag) == '2.0-preview'
input-file:
  - preview/2.0/alias.json
  - preview/2.0/data.json
  - preview/2.0/dataset.json
  - preview/2.0/dwgconversion.json
  - preview/2.0/featurestate.json
  - preview/1.0/spatial.json
  - preview/2.0/tileset.json

```

# Code Generation

## Swagger to SDK

This section describes what SDK should be generated by the automatic system.
This is not used by Autorest itself.

```yaml $(swagger-to-sdk)
swagger-to-sdk:
  - repo: azure-sdk-for-python-track2
  - repo: azure-sdk-for-java

  #track1 doesn't support data-plane for go
  #manually generate for now with track2
  #- repo: azure-sdk-for-go

  #track1 doesn't support features needed for typescript
  #manually generate for now with track2
  #- repo: azure-sdk-for-js

  #should be azure-sdk-for-net-track2, but SDK has not yet onboarded
  #manually generate for now with track2
  - repo: azure-sdk-for-net
```
