    **Search Address Batch API**



    **Applies to**: S1 pricing tier.

    

    The Search Address Batch API allows the caller to batch up to 10,000 [Search Address API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/maps/search/getsearchaddress) queries/requests using just a single API call.

    ### Submit Batch Request

    To send the _search address_ queries you will use a `POST` request where the request body will contain the `queries` array in `json` format and the `Content-Type` header will be set to `application/json`. Here's a sample request body containing 5 _search address_ queries:  

    <br>
    
    ```json

    {
        "queries": [
            "?query=400 Broad St, Seattle, WA 98109&limit=3",
            "?query=One, Microsoft Way, Redmond, WA 98052&limit=3",
            "?query=350 5th Ave, New York, NY 10118&limit=1",
            "?query=Pike Pl, Seattle, WA 98101&lat=47.610970&lon=-122.342469&radius=1000",
            "?query=Champ de Mars, 5 Avenue Anatole France, 75007 Paris, France&limit=1"
        ]
    }

    ```

    <br>
    A _search address_ query in a batch is just a partial URL _without_ the protocol, base URL, path, api-version and subscription-key. It can accept any of the supported _search address_ [URI parameters](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/maps/search/getsearchaddress#uri-parameters). The string values in the _search address_ query must be properly escaped (e.g. " character should be escaped with \\ ) and it should also be properly URL-encoded.    

    <br>
    
    The maximum number of queries that can be specified in the batch is **10,000** and the batch should contain at least **1** query.   

    <br>
    
    Please note that the Search Address Batch API is a long-running request. Here's a typical sequence of operations:

    1. Client sends a Search Address Batch `POST` request to Azure Maps

    2. The server will respond with one of the following:
        
        > HTTP `202 Accepted` - Batch request has been accepted.

        > HTTP `Error` - There was an error processing your Batch request. This could either be a `400 Bad Request` or any other `Error` status code.

    3. If the batch request was accepted successfully, the `Location` header in the response contains the URL to download the results of the batch request.

    4. Client issues a `GET` request on the _download URL_ obtained in Step 3 to download the batch results.


    <br>

    ### Download Batch Results

    To download the batch results you will issue a `GET` request to the batch download endpoint. This _download URL_ can be obtained from the `Location` header of a successful `POST` batch request and looks like the following:

    <br>
    
    ```

    https://atlas.microsoft.com/batch/{batch-id}?api-version=1.0&subscription-key={subscription-key}

    ```

    <br>
    Here's the typical sequence of operations for downloading the batch results:

    1. Client sends a `GET` request using the _download URL_.

    2. The server will respond with one of the following:
        
        > HTTP `202 Accepted` - Batch request was accepted but is still being processed. Please try again in some time.

        > HTTP `200 OK` - Batch request successfully processed. The response body contains all the batch results.
    
    <br>

    ### Batch Response Model

    When downloading the results of a batch request, if the batch has finished processing, the response body contains the batch response. This batch response contains a `summary` component that indicates the `totalRequests` that were part of the original batch request and `successfulRequests` i.e. queries which were executed successfully. The batch response also includes a `batchResults` array which contains a response for each and every query in the batch request. Also, the `batchResults` will contain the results in the exact same order the original queries were sent in the batch request. Each entry in `batchResults` is of one of the following types:

      - [`SearchAddressResponse`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/maps/search/getsearchaddress#searchaddressresponse) - If the query completed successfully.

      - `Error` - If the query failed. The result will contain a `status code` and a `message` in this case.
      
    <br>
    Here's a sample Batch Response with 2 _successful_ and 1 _failed_ result:

    <br>
    
    ```json

    {
        "summary": {
            "successfulRequests": 2,
            "totalRequests": 3
        },
        "batchResults": [
            {
                "summary": {
                    "query": "one microsoft way redmond wa 98052"
                },
                "results": [
                    {
                        "position": {
                            "lat": 47.63989,
                            "lon": -122.12509
                        }
                    }
                ]
            },
            {
                "summary": {
                    "query": "pike pl seattle wa 98101"
                },
                "results": [
                    {
                        "position": {
                            "lat": 47.60963,
                            "lon": -122.34215
                        }
                    }
                ]
            },
            {
                "statusCode": 400,
                "message": "Bad Request"
            }
        ]
    }

    ```
