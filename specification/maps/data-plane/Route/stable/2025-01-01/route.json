When paired with [Azure role-based access](/azure/role-based-access-control/overview) control it can be used to control access to Azure Maps REST APIs. Azure role-based access controls are used to designate access to one or more Azure Maps resource account or sub-resources. Any user, group, or service principal can be granted access via a  built-in role or a custom role composed of one or more permissions to Azure Maps REST APIs.\n\nTo implement scenarios, we recommend viewing [authentication concepts](https://aka.ms/amauth). In summary, this security definition provides a solution for modeling application(s) via objects capable of access control on specific APIs and scopes.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> * This security definition **requires** the use of the `x-ms-client-id` header to indicate which Azure Maps resource the application is requesting access to. This can be acquired from the [Maps management API](https://aka.ms/amauthdetails).\n> * The `Authorization URL` is specific to the Azure public cloud instance. Sovereign clouds have unique Authorization URLs and Microsoft Entra ID configurations. \n> * The Azure role-based access control is configured from the [Azure management plane](https://aka.ms/amrbac) via Azure portal, PowerShell, CLI, Azure SDKs, or REST APIs.\n> * Usage of the [Azure Maps Web SDK](https://aka.ms/amaadmc) allows for configuration based setup of an application for multiple use cases.\n> *  For more information on Microsoft identity platform, see [Microsoft identity platform overview](/entra/identity-platform/v2-overview).\n\n",

        "description": "\n\nThe `Route Directions` API is an HTTP `POST` request that returns the ideal route between an origin and destination for automobile (driving), commercial trucks and walking routes. The route passes through a series of waypoints if specified. A waypoint is a geographical location defined by longitude and latitude that is used for navigational purposes. The route considers factors such as current traffic and the typical road speeds on the requested day of the week and time of day.\n\nThe API returns the distance, estimated travel time, and a representation of the route geometry. More routing information such as an optimized waypoint order or turn by turn instructions is also available, depending on the parameters used.\n\nThe Route Directions considers local laws, vehicle dimensions, cargo type, max speed, bridge and tunnel heights to calculate the truck specific routes and avoid complex maneuvers and difficult roads. Not all trucks can travel the same routes as other vehicles due to certain restrictions based on the vehicle profile or cargo type. For example, highways often have separate speed limits for trucks, some roads don't allow trucks with flammable or hazardous materials, and there can be height and weight restriction on bridges.\n\nUp to 150 waypoints and 10 viaWaypoints between any two waypoints is supported. Each set of waypoints creates a separate route Leg. ViaWaypoints define the route path and can be used for route creation through specific locations, but they don't create route Legs.\n\nFor information about routing availability in countries/regions, see [Azure Maps routing coverage](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-maps/routing-coverage?pivots=latest).\n\n",

When the service receives a request, it will respond as soon as the batch items are calculated and there will be no possibility to retrieve the results later. The Synchronous API will return a timeout error (a 408 response) if the request takes longer than 60 seconds.

Here's a sample request body containing 2 _directions_ queries:\n\n\n```\n{\n  \"batchItems\": [\n    {\n      \"optionalId\": \"bbc9c0f6-ab52-49d8-a788-a658fa654c94\",\n      \"type\": \"FeatureCollection\",\n      \"features\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"Feature\",\n          \"geometry\": {\n            \"coordinates\": [\n              -122.3368,\n              47.614988\n            ],\n            \"type\": \"Point\"\n          },\n          \"properties\": {\n            \"pointIndex\": 0,\n            \"pointType\": \"waypoint\"\n          }\n        },\n        {\n          \"type\": \"Feature\",\n          \"geometry\": {\n            \"coordinates\": [\n              -122.316067,\n              47.606356\n            ],\n            \"type\": \"Point\"\n          },\n          \"properties\": {\n            \"pointIndex\": 1,\n            \"pointType\": \"waypoint\"\n          }\n        }\n      ],\n      \"optimizeRoute\": \"fastestWithoutTraffic\",\n      \"routeOutputOptions\": [\n        \"routeSummary\"\n      ],\n      \"maxRouteCount\": 3,\n      \"travelMode\": \"driving\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"optionalId\": \"a191de3c-1268-4986-98f0-03f0a5d9302a\",\n      \"type\": \"FeatureCollection\",\n      \"features\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"Feature\",\n          \"geometry\": {\n            \"coordinates\": [\n              -122.3368,\n              47.614988\n            ],\n            \"type\": \"Point\"\n          },\n          \"properties\": {\n            \"pointIndex\": 0,\n            \"pointType\": \"waypoint\"\n          }\n        },\n        {\n          \"type\": \"Feature\",\n          \"geometry\": {\n            \"coordinates\": [\n              -122.316067,\n              47.606356\n            ],\n            \"type\": \"Point\"\n          },\n          \"properties\": {\n            \"pointIndex\": 1,\n            \"pointType\": \"waypoint\"\n          }\n        }\n      ],\n      \"optimizeRoute\": \"shortest\",\n      \"routeOutputOptions\": [\n        \"routeSummary\"\n      ],\n      \"maxRouteCount\": 2,\n      \"travelMode\": \"driving\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n ```\n\nA _directions_ batchItem object can accept any of the supported _directions_ [Request body](/rest/api/maps/route/post-route-directions?view=rest-maps-2025-01-01#request-body) \n\n\nThe batch should contain at least **1** query.\n\n\n### Batch Response Model\nThe batch response contains a `summary` component that indicates the `totalRequests` that were part of the original batch request and `successfulRequests` i.e. queries which were executed successfully. The batch response also includes a `batchItems` array which contains a response for each and every query in the batch request. The `batchItems` will contain the results in the exact same order the original queries were sent in the batch request. Each item is of one of the following types:\n\n  - [`DirectionsResponse`](/rest/api/maps/route/post-directions#response) - If the query completed successfully.\n\n  - `Error` - If the query failed. The response will contain a `code` and a `message` in this case.\n\n\n",

Here's a sample request body containing 2 _snap to roads_ queries:\n\n\n```\n{\n  \"batchItems\": [\n    {\n      \"optionalId\": \"bbc9c0f6-ab52-49d8-a788-a658fa654c94\",\n      \"type\": \"FeatureCollection\",\n      \"features\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"Feature\",\n          \"geometry\": {\n            \"type\": \"Point\",\n            \"coordinates\": [\n              -122.336691,\n              47.59085\n            ]\n          },\n          \"properties\": {\n          }\n        }\n      ],\n      \"includeSpeedLimit\": true,\n      \"travelMode\": \"driving\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"optionalId\": \"300af787-589b-4088-accd-56828542e293\",\n      \"type\": \"FeatureCollection\",\n      \"features\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"Feature\",\n          \"geometry\": {\n            \"type\": \"Point\",\n            \"coordinates\": [\n              -122.336023,\n              47.601616\n            ]\n          },\n          \"properties\": {\n          }\n        }\n      ],\n      \"includeSpeedLimit\": true,\n      \"travelMode\": \"driving\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nA _snap to roads_ batchItem object can accept any of the supported _snap to roads_ [Request body](/rest/api/maps/route/post-snap-to-roads?view=rest-maps-2025-01-01#request-body) \n\n\nThe batch should contain at least **1** query.\n\n\n### Batch Response Model\nThe batch response contains a `summary` component that indicates the `totalRequests` that were part of the original batch request and `successfulRequests` i.e. queries which were executed successfully. The batch response also includes a `batchItems` array which contains a response for each and every query in the batch request. The `batchItems` will contain the results in the exact same order the original queries were sent in the batch request. Each item is of one of the following types:\n\n  - [`SnapToRoadsResponse`](/rest/api/maps/route/post-snap-to-roads#response) - If the query completed successfully.\n\n  - `Error` - If the query failed. The response will contain a `code` and a `message` in this case.\n\n\n",

For every given origin, the service calculates the cost of routing from that origin to every given destination. The set of origins and the set of destinations can be thought of as the column and row headers of a table and each cell in the table contains the costs of routing from the origin to the destination for that cell. Route Matrices can be calculated for driving, walking and truck routes. For example, a food delivery company has 20 drivers and they need to find the closest driver to pick up the delivery from the restaurant. To solve this use case, they can call the Route Matrix API and use the travel cost to sort the drivers by their actual travel distance or time from the restaurant.\n\n\nRoute Matrices are used in several different types of applications, most commonly to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP). For each origin-destination pair in the matrix, the travel time and distance are returned. You can use the computed costs to determine which detailed routes to calculate using the Route Directions API.\n\n\nThe maximum size of a matrix for sync request it's **2500** (the number of origins multiplied by the number of destinations).\n\n\n\n### Submit Synchronous Route Matrix Request\nIf your scenario requires synchronous requests and the maximum size of the matrix is less than or equal to 2500, you might want to make synchronous request.

With that constraint in mind, examples of possible matrix dimensions are: 50x50, 60x40, 90x20 (it does not need to be square).\n\n\n\n### API Limitations\n The synchronous processing of matrix is best suited for fast, small matrices of route calculation. To calculate larger matrices and heavy route calculation, use the asynchronous endpoint. The following limitation is applicable to the synchronous requests. If none of the rows in the following table match the request's parameters, the request does not meet the requirements and will not be processed.\n\n| Max matrix size | Max number of origins  | Max number of destinations | Additional limits\n |------------------|------------------------|----------------------------|------------|\n| 100              | 100         | 100              | N/A |\n| 200              | 200         | 200              | All origins and destinations should be contained in an axis-aligned 400 km x 400 km bounding box.

        "description": "The `Route Matrix Async` API is an HTTP `POST` request that allows calculation of a matrix of route summaries for a set of routes defined by origin and destination locations by using an asynchronous (async) request. For every given origin, the service calculates the cost of routing from that origin to every given destination. The set of origins and the set of destinations can be thought of as the column and row headers of a table and each cell in the table contains the costs of routing from the origin to the destination for that cell.  Route Matrices can be calculated for driving, walking and truck routes.\n\nRoute Matrices are used in several different types of applications, most commonly to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP).

You can use the computed costs to determine which detailed routes to calculate using the Route Directions API.\n\n\nThe maximum size of a matrix for async request is **50000** (the number of origins multiplied by the number of destinations).\n\n\n### Submit Asynchronous Route Matrix Request\nThe Asynchronous API is appropriate for processing big volumes of relatively complex routing requests. When you make a request by using async request, by default the service returns a 202 response code along a URL in the `operation-Location` field of the response header with the Azure Maps geography endpoint `{geography}.atlas.microsoft.com. This URL should be checked periodically until the status is Succeeded. \n\n\nThe maximum size of a matrix for this API is **50000** (the number of origins multiplied by the number of destinations).

The redirect URL returns a 404 response if used after the expiration period.\n\n\n\n\n```\nPOST https://atlas.microsoft.com/route/matrix:async?api-version=2025-01-01&subscription-key={subscription-key}\n```\n\nHere's a typical sequence of asynchronous operations:\n1. Client sends a Route Matrix POST request to Azure Maps\n\n2. The server will respond with one of the following:\n\n    > HTTP `202 Accepted` -  Route Matrix request has been accepted.\n\n    > HTTP `Error` - There was an error processing your Route Matrix request. This could either be a 400 Bad Request or any other Error status code.\n\n\n3. If the Matrix Route request was accepted successfully, the `operation-location` header in the response contains the URL to get the status of the request. This status URI looks like the following:\n\n  ```\n    GET https://atlas.microsoft.com/route/operations/{id}?api-version=2025-01-01?subscription-key={subscription-key}\n  ```\n\n\n4. Client issues a GET request on the resultUrl obtained in Step 3 to get the results\n\n \n\n  ```\n    GET https://atlas.microsoft.com/route/operations/{id}/result?api-version=2025-01-01?subscription-key={subscription-key}\n   ```\n\n\n\n ### API Limitations\n The asynchronous processing of matrix is best suited for larger matrices that require heavy route calculation.
