When paired with [Azure role-based access](/azure/role-based-access-control/overview) control it can be used to control access to Azure Maps REST APIs. Azure role-based access controls are used to designate access to one or more Azure Maps resource account or sub-resources. Any user, group, or service principal can be granted access via a  built-in role or a custom role composed of one or more permissions to Azure Maps REST APIs.\n\nTo implement scenarios, we recommend viewing [authentication concepts](https://aka.ms/amauth). In summary, this security definition provides a solution for modeling application(s) via objects capable of access control on specific APIs and scopes.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> * This security definition **requires** the use of the `x-ms-client-id` header to indicate which Azure Maps resource the application is requesting access to. This can be acquired from the [Maps management API](https://aka.ms/amauthdetails).\n> * The `Authorization URL` is specific to the Azure public cloud instance. Sovereign clouds have unique Authorization URLs and Microsoft Entra ID configurations. \n> * The Azure role-based access control is configured from the [Azure management plane](https://aka.ms/amrbac) via Azure portal, PowerShell, CLI, Azure SDKs, or REST APIs.\n> * Usage of the [Azure Maps Web SDK](https://aka.ms/amaadmc) allows for configuration based setup of an application for multiple use cases.\n> *  For more information on Microsoft identity platform, see [Microsoft identity platform overview](/entra/identity-platform/v2-overview).\n\n",

        "description": "\n\nThe `Route Directions` API is an HTTP `POST` request that returns the ideal route between an origin and destination for automobile (driving), commercial trucks and walking routes. The route passes through a series of waypoints if specified. A waypoint is a geographical location defined by longitude and latitude that is used for navigational purposes. The route considers factors such as current traffic and the typical road speeds on the requested day of the week and time of day.\n\nThe API returns the distance, estimated travel time, and a representation of the route geometry. More routing information such as an optimized waypoint order or turn by turn instructions is also available, depending on the parameters used.\n\nThe Route Directions considers local laws, vehicle dimensions, cargo type, max speed, bridge and tunnel heights to calculate the truck specific routes and avoid complex maneuvers and difficult roads. Not all trucks can travel the same routes as other vehicles due to certain restrictions based on the vehicle profile or cargo type. For example, highways often have separate speed limits for trucks, some roads don't allow trucks with flammable or hazardous materials, and there can be height and weight restriction on bridges.\n\nUp to 25 waypoints and 10 viaWaypoints between any two waypoints is supported for driving and walking routes. Each set of waypoints creates a separate route Leg. ViaWaypoints define the route path and can be used for route creation through specific locations, but they don't create route Legs. Truck routes support up to 150 waypoints but don't support viaWaypoints.\n\nFor information about routing availability in countries/regions, see [Azure Maps routing coverage](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-maps/routing-coverage?pivots=route-v2).\n\n>[!Important]\n>By using this feature, you agree to the preview legal terms.

When the service receives a request, it will respond as soon as the batch items are calculated and there will be no possibility to retrieve the results later. The Synchronous API will return a timeout error (a 408 response) if the request takes longer than 60 seconds.

Here's a sample request body containing 2 _directions_ queries:\n\n\n```\n{\n  \"batchItems\": [\n    {\n      \"optionalId\": \"bbc9c0f6-ab52-49d8-a788-a658fa654c94\",\n      \"type\": \"FeatureCollection\",\n      \"features\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"Feature\",\n          \"geometry\": {\n            \"coordinates\": [\n              -122.3368,\n              47.614988\n            ],\n            \"type\": \"Point\"\n          },\n          \"properties\": {\n            \"pointIndex\": 0,\n            \"pointType\": \"waypoint\"\n          }\n        },\n        {\n          \"type\": \"Feature\",\n          \"geometry\": {\n            \"coordinates\": [\n              -122.316067,\n              47.606356\n            ],\n            \"type\": \"Point\"\n          },\n          \"properties\": {\n            \"pointIndex\": 1,\n            \"pointType\": \"waypoint\"\n          }\n        }\n      ],\n      \"optimizeRoute\": \"fastestWithoutTraffic\",\n      \"routeOutputOptions\": [\n        \"routeSummary\"\n      ],\n      \"maxRouteCount\": 3,\n      \"travelMode\": \"driving\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"optionalId\": \"a191de3c-1268-4986-98f0-03f0a5d9302a\",\n      \"type\": \"FeatureCollection\",\n      \"features\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"Feature\",\n          \"geometry\": {\n            \"coordinates\": [\n              -122.3368,\n              47.614988\n            ],\n            \"type\": \"Point\"\n          },\n          \"properties\": {\n            \"pointIndex\": 0,\n            \"pointType\": \"waypoint\"\n          }\n        },\n        {\n          \"type\": \"Feature\",\n          \"geometry\": {\n            \"coordinates\": [\n              -122.316067,\n              47.606356\n            ],\n            \"type\": \"Point\"\n          },\n          \"properties\": {\n            \"pointIndex\": 1,\n            \"pointType\": \"waypoint\"\n          }\n        }\n      ],\n      \"optimizeRoute\": \"shortest\",\n      \"routeOutputOptions\": [\n        \"routeSummary\"\n      ],\n      \"maxRouteCount\": 2,\n      \"travelMode\": \"driving\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n ```\n\nA _directions_ batchItem object can accept any of the supported _directions_ [Request body](/rest/api/maps/route/post-directions?view=rest-maps-2023-10-01-preview#request-body) \n\n\nThe batch should contain at least **1** query.\n\n\n### Batch Response Model\nThe batch response contains a `summary` component that indicates the `totalRequests` that were part of the original batch request and `successfulRequests` i.e. queries which were executed successfully. The batch response also includes a `batchItems` array which contains a response for each and every query in the batch request. The `batchItems` will contain the results in the exact same order the original queries were sent in the batch request. Each item is of one of the following types:\n\n  - [`DirectionsResponse`](/rest/api/maps/route/post-directions#response) - If the query completed successfully.\n\n  - `Error` - If the query failed. The response will contain a `code` and a `message` in this case.\n\n\n",

Here's a sample request body containing 2 _snap to roads_ queries:\n\n\n```\n{\n  \"batchItems\": [\n    {\n      \"type\": \"FeatureCollection\",\n      \"features\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"Feature\",\n          \"geometry\": {\n            \"coordinates\": [\n              -122.122353,\n              47.672662\n            ],\n            \"type\": \"Point\"\n          },\n          \"properties\": {\n                         \n          }\n        },\n        {\n          \"type\": \"Feature\",\n          \"geometry\": {\n            \"coordinates\": [\n              -122.132452,\n              47.644234\n            ],\n            \"type\": \"Point\"\n          },\n          \"properties\": {\n                             \n          }\n        }\n      ],\n      \"interpolate\": true,\n      \"includeSpeedLimit\": true,\n      \"travelMode\": \"driving\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"type\": \"FeatureCollection\",\n      \"features\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"Feature\",\n          \"geometry\": {\n            \"coordinates\": [\n              -122.33669,\n              47.590849\n            ],\n            \"type\": \"Point\"\n          },\n          \"properties\": {\n            \"pointIndex\": 0\n          }\n        },\n        {\n          \"type\": \"Feature\",\n          \"geometry\": {\n            \"coordinates\": [\n              122.34509,\n              47.610524\n            ],\n            \"type\": \"Point\"\n          },\n          \"properties\": {\n            \"pointIndex\": 1\n          }\n        }\n      ],\n      \"interpolate\": false,\n      \"includeSpeedLimit\": false,\n      \"travelMode\": \"driving\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nA _snap to roads_ batchItem object can accept any of the supported _snap to roads_ [Request body](/rest/api/maps/route/post-snap-to-roads?view=rest-maps-2024-07-01-preview#request-body) \n\n\nThe batch should contain at least **1** query.\n\n\n### Batch Response Model\nThe batch response contains a `summary` component that indicates the `totalRequests` that were part of the original batch request and `successfulRequests` i.e. queries which were executed successfully. The batch response also includes a `batchItems` array which contains a response for each and every query in the batch request. The `batchItems` will contain the results in the exact same order the original queries were sent in the batch request. Each item is of one of the following types:\n\n  - [`SnapToRoadsResponse`](/rest/api/maps/route/post-snap-to-roads#response) - If the query completed successfully.\n\n  - `Error` - If the query failed. The response will contain a `code` and a `message` in this case.\n\n\n",
