### Basic Information

These are the global settings for Route Client.

``` yaml

# at some point those credentials will move away to Swagger according to [this](https://github.com/Azure/autorest/issues/3718)
add-credentials: true

### Tag: 1.0

These settings apply only when `--tag=1.0` is specified on the command line.

``` yaml $(tag) == '1.0'
input-file:
  - preview/1.0/route.json
```

# Code Generation

## Swagger to SDK

This section describes what SDK should be generated by the automatic system.
This is not used by Autorest itself.

```yaml $(swagger-to-sdk)
swagger-to-sdk:
  - repo: azure-sdk-for-python-track2
  - repo: azure-sdk-for-java

  #track1 doesn't support data-plane for go
  #manually generate for now with track2
  #- repo: azure-sdk-for-go

  #track1 doesn't support features needed for typescript
  #manually generate for now with track2
  #- repo: azure-sdk-for-js

  #should be azure-sdk-for-net-track2, but SDK has not yet onboarded
  #manually generate for now with track2
  - repo: azure-sdk-for-net
```
