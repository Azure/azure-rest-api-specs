  StaticImagePinsParameterDescription: |-
    Pushpin style and instances. Use this parameter to optionally add pushpins to the image.
    The pushpin style describes the appearance of the pushpins, and the instances specify
    the coordinates of the pushpins and optional labels for each pin. (Be sure to properly URL-encode values of this
    parameter since it will contain reserved characters such as pipes and punctuation.)

    The Azure Maps account S0 SKU only supports a single instance of the pins parameter. Other SKUs
    allow multiple instances of the pins parameter to specify multiple pin styles.

    To render a pushpin at latitude 45°N and longitude 122°W using the default built-in pushpin style, add the
    querystring parameter 

    `pins=default||-122 45` 

    Note that the longitude comes before the latitude.
    After URL encoding this will look like

    `pins=default%7C%7C45+-122`

    All of the examples here show the pins
    parameter without URL encoding, for clarity.

    To render a pin at multiple locations, separate each location with a pipe character. For example, use

    `pins=default||-122 45|-119.5 43.2|-121.67 47.12`

    The S0 Azure Maps account SKU only allows five pushpins. Other account SKUs do not have this limitation.

    ### Style Modifiers

    You can modify the appearance of the pins by adding style modifiers. These are added after the style but before
    the locations and labels. Style modifiers each have a two-letter name. These abbreviated names are used to help
    reduce the length of the URL.

    To change the color of the pushpin, use the 'co' style modifier and specify the color using the HTML/CSS RGB color
    format which is a six-digit hexadecimal number (the three-digit form is not supported). For example, to use
    a deep pink color which you would specify as #FF1493 in CSS, use
    
    `pins=default|coFF1493||-122 45`

    ### Pushpin Labels

    To add a label to the pins, put the label in single quotes just before the coordinates. For example, to label
    three pins with the values '1', '2', and '3', use
    
    `pins=default||'1'-122 45|'2'-119.5 43.2|'3'-121.67 47.12`

    There is a built in pushpin style called 'none' that does not display a pushpin image. You can use this if
    you want to display labels without any pin image. For example,
    
    `pins=none||'A'-122 45|'B'-119.5 43.2`

    To change the color of the pushpin labels, use the 'lc' label color style modifier. For example, to use pink
    pushpins with black labels, use
    
    `pins=default|coFF1493|lc000000||-122 45`

    To change the size of the labels, use the 'ls' label size style modifier. The label size represents the approximate
    height of the label text in pixels. For example, to increase the label size to 12, use

    `pins=default|ls12||'A'-122 45|'B'-119 43`

    The labels are centered at the pushpin 'label anchor.' The anchor location is predefined for built-in pushpins and
    is at the top center of custom pushpins (see below). To override the label anchor, using the 'la' style modifier
    and provide X and Y pixel coordinates for the anchor. These coordinates are relative to the top left corner of the
    pushpin image. Positive X values move the anchor to the right, and positive Y values move the anchor down. For example,
    to position the label anchor 10 pixels right and 4 pixels above the top left corner of the pushpin image,
    use
    
    `pins=default|la10 -4||'A'-122 45|'B'-119 43`

    ### Custom Pushpins

    To use a custom pushpin image, use the word 'custom' as the pin style name, and then specify a URL after the
    location and label information. Use two pipe characters to indicate that you're done specifying locations and are
    starting the URL. For example,
    
    `pins=custom||-122 45||http://contoso.com/pushpins/red.png`
    
    After URL encoding, this would look like
    
    `pins=custom%7C%7C-122+45%7C%7Chttp%3A%2F%2Fcontoso.com%2Fpushpins%2Fred.png`

    By default, custom pushpin images are drawn centered at the pin coordinates. This usually isn't ideal as it obscures
    the location that you're trying to highlight. To override the anchor location of the pin image, use the 'an'
    style modifier. This uses the same format as the 'la' label anchor style modifier. For example, if your custom
    pin image has the tip of the pin at the top left corner of the image, you can set the anchor to that spot by
    using
    
    `pins=custom|an0 0||-122 45||http://contoso.com/pushpins/red.png`

    Note: If you use the 'co' color modifier with a custom pushpin image, the specified color will replace the RGB 
    channels of the pixels in the image but will leave the alpha (opacity) channel unchanged. This would usually
    only be done with a solid-color custom image.

    ### Getting Pushpins from Azure Maps Data Storage

    For all Azure Maps account SKUs other than S0,
    the pushpin image and location information can be obtained from Azure Maps Data Storage. After uploading a pushpin image
    or a GeoJSON document containing pin locations, the Data Storage service returns a Unique Data ID (UDID) that you can use
    to reference the data in the pins parameter.

    To use a custom pushpin image from Azure Maps Data Storage, specify the UDID prefixed by 'udid-' as the name of the
    pushpin style. For example,
    
    `pins=udid-fe22c504-3a81-4fcd-adc6-a3507ce866c1||-122 45`

    To use the point geometry from an uploaded GeoJSON document as the pin locations, specify the UDID in the locations
    section of the pins parameter. For example,
    
    `pins=default||udid-29dc105a-dee7-409f-a3f9-22b066ae4713`
    
    Note that
    only point and multipoint geometry, points and multipoints from geometry collections, and point geometry from features
    will be used. Linestring and polygon geometry will be ignored. If the point comes from a feature and the feature
    has a string property called "label", the value of that property will be used as the label for the pin.

    You can mix pin locations from Data Storage and pin locations specified in the pins parameter. Any of the pipe-delimited
    pin locations can be a longitude and latitude or a UDID. For example,

    `pins=default||-122 45|udid-29dc105a-dee7-409f-a3f9-22b066ae4713|-119 43`

    ### Scale, Rotation, and Opacity

    You can make pushpins and their labels larger or smaller by using the 'sc' scale style modifier. This is a
    value greater than zero. A value of 1 is the standard scale. Values larger than 1 will make the pins larger, and
    values smaller than 1 will make them smaller. For example, to draw the pushpins 50% larger than normal, use

    `pins=default|sc1.5||-122 45`

    You can rotate pushpins and their labels by using the 'ro' rotation style modifier. This is a number of degrees
    of clockwise rotation. Use a negative number to rotate counter-clockwise. For example, to rotate the pushpins
    90 degrees clockwise and double their size, use
    
    `pins=default|ro90|sc2||-122 45`

    You can make pushpins and their labels partially transparent by specifying the 'al' alpha style modifier.
    This is a number between 0 and 1 indicating the opacity of the pushpins. Zero makes them completely transparent
    (and not visible) and 1 makes them completely opaque (which is the default). For example, to make pushpins
    and their labels only 67% opaque, use
    
    `pins=default|al.67||-122 45`

    ### Style Modifier Summary

    Modifier  | Description     | Range            
    :--------:|-----------------|------------------
    al        | Alpha (opacity) | 0 to 1           
    an        | Pin anchor      | *                
    co        | Pin color       | 000000 to FFFFFF 
    la        | Label anchor    | *                
    lc        | Label color     | 000000 to FFFFFF 
    ls        | Label size      | Greater than 0   
    ro        | Rotation        | -360 to 360      
    sc        | Scale           | Greater than 0   

    * X and Y coordinates can be anywhere within pin image or a margin around it.
    The margin size is the minimum of the pin width and height.
    
  StaticImagePathParameterDescription: |-
    Path style and locations. Use this parameter to optionally add lines, polygons or circles to the image.
    The path style describes the appearance of the line and fill. (Be sure to properly URL-encode values of this
    parameter since it will contain reserved characters such as pipes and punctuation.)

    Path parameter is supported in Azure Maps account SKU starting with S1. Multiple instances of the path parameter 
    allow to specify multiple geometries with their styles. Nuber of parameters per request is limited to 10 and
    number of locations is limited to 100 per path.

    To render a circle with radius 100 meters and center point at latitude 45°N and longitude 122°W using the default style, add the
    querystring parameter 

    `path=ra100||-122 45` 

    Note that the longitude comes before the latitude.
    After URL encoding this will look like

    `path=ra100%7C%7C45+-122`

    All of the examples here show the path parameter without URL encoding, for clarity.

    To render a line, separate each location with a pipe character. For example, use

    `path=||-122 45|-119.5 43.2|-121.67 47.12`

    To render a polygon, last location must be equal to the start location. For example, use

    `path=||-122 45|-119.5 43.2|-121.67 47.12|-122 45`

    Longitude and latitude values for locations of lines and polygons can be in the range from -360 to 360 to allow for rendering of geometries crossing the anti-meridian.

    ### Style Modifiers

    You can modify the appearance of the path by adding style modifiers. These are added before the locations. 
    Style modifiers each have a two-letter name. These abbreviated names are used to help
    reduce the length of the URL.

    To change the color of the outline, use the 'lc' style modifier and specify the color using the HTML/CSS RGB color
    format which is a six-digit hexadecimal number (the three-digit form is not supported). For example, to use
    a deep pink color which you would specify as #FF1493 in CSS, use
    
    `path=lcFF1493||-122 45|-119.5 43.2`

    Multiple style modifiers may be combined together to create a more complex visual style.

    `lc0000FF|lw3|la0.60|fa0.50||-122.2 47.6|-122.2 47.7|-122.3 47.7|-122.3 47.6|-122.2 47.6`

    ### Getting Path locations from Azure Maps Data Storage

    For all Azure Maps account SKUs other than S0, the path location information can be obtained from Azure Maps Data Storage. 
    After uploading a GeoJSON document containing path locations, the Data Storage service returns a Unique Data ID (UDID) that you can use
    to reference the data in the path parameter.

    To use the point geometry from an uploaded GeoJSON document as the path locations, specify the UDID in the locations
    section of the path parameter. For example,
    
    `path=||udid-29dc105a-dee7-409f-a3f9-22b066ae4713`
    
    Note the it is not allowed to mix path locations from Data Storage with locations specified in the path parameter.
