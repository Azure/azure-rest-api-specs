The node has to be down for this operation to be successful. This operation lets Service Fabric know that the replicas on that node no longer exist, and that Service Fabric should stop waiting for those replicas to come back up. Do not run this cmdlet if the state on the node has not been removed and the node can come back up with its state intact. Starting from Service Fabric 6.5, in order to use this API for seed nodes, please change the seed nodes to regular (non-seed) nodes and then invoke this API to remove the node state. If the cluster is running on Azure, after the seed node goes down, Service Fabric will try to change it to a non-seed node automatically. To make this happen, make sure the number of non-seed nodes in the primary node type is no less than the number of Down seed nodes. If necessary, add more nodes to the primary node type to achieve this. For standalone cluster, if the Down seed node is not expected to come back up with its state intact, please remove the node from the cluster, see https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-cluster-windows-server-add-remove-nodes",

The set of properties that can be updated are a subset of the properties that were specified at the time of creating the service.

Note that updating the properties of a running service is different than upgrading your application using `StartApplicationUpgrade` API. The upgrade is a long running background operation that involves moving the application from one version to another, one upgrade domain at a time, whereas update applies the new properties immediately to the service.",

The selection can be done based on the entities health state and based on the hierarchy.\nThe query can return multi-level children of the entities based on the specified filters. For example, it can return one application with a specified name, and for this application, return\nonly services that are in Error or Warning, and all partitions and replicas for one of these services.",
