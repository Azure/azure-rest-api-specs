  "operationId": "GetApplicationTypeInfoListByName",
  "description": "Returns the information about the application types that are provisioned or in the process of being provisioned in the Service Fabric cluster. These results are of application types whose name match exactly the one specified as the parameter, and which comply with the given query parameters. All versions of the application type matching the application type name are returned, with each version returned as one application type. The response includes the name, version, status, and other details about the application type. This is a paged query, meaning that if not all of the application types fit in a page, one page of results is returned as well as a continuation token, which can be used to get the next page. For example, if there are 10 application types but a page only fits the first three application types, or if max results is set to 3, then three is returned. To access the rest of the results, retrieve subsequent pages by using the returned continuation token in the next query. An empty continuation token is returned if there are no subsequent pages.",
