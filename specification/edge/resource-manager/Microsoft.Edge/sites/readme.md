## Suppression

``` yaml
directive:
  - suppress: OperationsAPIImplementation
    from: sites.json
    reason: RP is in PublicPreview and no SDK has been released yet. Microsoft.Edge RP consist of multiple resources which are owned/maintained by different teams, so we follow folder structure for Service Group (explained here https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs-pr/tree/RPSaaSMaster?tab=readme-ov-file#folder-structure-for-service-group). We do have operations api exposed from common-location/folder (https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs-pr/blob/RPSaaSMaster/specification/edge/resource-manager/Microsoft.Edge/edge/preview/2024-02-01-preview/operations.json#L46C5-L46C43) so every resource need not expose it separately. There has been open issue [Avocado] Support service group folder scenario azure-sdk-tools#6201 for the same.
```

## Configuration

### Basic Information

These are the global settings for the edgesites.

```yaml
openapi-type: arm
openapi-subtype: rpaas
tag: package-2024-02-01-preview
```

### Tag: package-2024-02-01-preview

These settings apply only when `--tag=package-2024-02-01-preview` is specified on the command line.

```yaml $(tag) == 'package-2024-02-01-preview'
input-file:
  - preview/2024-02-01-preview/sites.json
```
