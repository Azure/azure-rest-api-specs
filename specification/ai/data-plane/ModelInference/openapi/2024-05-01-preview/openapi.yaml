        Gets chat completions for the provided chat messages.
        Completions support a wide variety of tasks and generate text that continues from or "completes"
        provided prompt data. The method makes a REST API call to the `/chat/completions` route
        on the given endpoint.

            Setting to `{ "type": "json_object" }` enables JSON mode, which ensures the message the model generates is valid JSON.

            **Important:** when using JSON mode, you **must** also instruct the model to produce JSON yourself via a system or user message. Without this, the model may generate an unending stream of whitespace until the generation reaches the token limit, resulting in a long-running and seemingly "stuck" request. Also note that the message content may be partially cut off if `finish_reason="length"`, which indicates the generation exceeded `max_tokens` or the conversation exceeded the max context length.

        the your model.
