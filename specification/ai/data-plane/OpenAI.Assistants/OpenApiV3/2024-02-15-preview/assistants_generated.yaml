        Each event in a server-sent events stream has an `event` and `data` property:

        ```
        event: thread.created
        data: {"id": "thread_123", "object": "thread", ...}
        ```

        We emit events whenever a new object is created, transitions to a new state, or is being
        streamed in parts (deltas). For example, we emit `thread.run.created` when a new run
        is created, `thread.run.completed` when a run completes, and so on. When an Assistant chooses
        to create a message during a run, we emit a `thread.message.created event`, a
        `thread.message.in_progress` event, many `thread.message.delta` events, and finally a
        `thread.message.completed` event.

        We may add additional events over time, so we recommend handling unknown events gracefully
        in your code.
