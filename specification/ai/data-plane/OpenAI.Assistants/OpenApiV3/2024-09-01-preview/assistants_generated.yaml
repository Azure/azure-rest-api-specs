        ```

        We emit events whenever a new object is created, transitions to a new state, or is being
        streamed in parts (deltas). For example, we emit `thread.run.created` when a new run
        is created, `thread.run.completed` when a run completes, and so on. When an Assistant chooses
        to create a message during a run, we emit a `thread.message.created event`, a
        `thread.message.in_progress` event, many `thread.message.delta` events, and finally a
        `thread.message.completed` event.

        We may add additional events over time, so we recommend handling unknown events gracefully
        in your code.

        Setting to `{ "type": "json_object" }` enables JSON mode, which guarantees the message the model generates is valid JSON.

        **Important:** when using JSON mode, you **must** also instruct the model to produce JSON yourself via a system or user message.
        Without this, the model may generate an unending stream of whitespace until the generation reaches the token limit,
        resulting in a long-running and seemingly "stuck" request. Also note that the message content may be partially cut off
        if `finish_reason="length"`, which indicates the generation exceeded `max_tokens` or the conversation exceeded the max context length.

            An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the model considers the results of the tokens with top_p probability mass.
            So 0.1 means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered.

            We generally recommend altering this or temperature but not both.
