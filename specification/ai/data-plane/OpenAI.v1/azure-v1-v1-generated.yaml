                    Setting to `{ "type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {...} }` enables
                    Structured Outputs which ensures the model will match your supplied JSON
                    schema.

                    Setting to `{ "type": "json_object" }` enables JSON mode, which ensures
                    the message the model generates is valid JSON.

                    **Important:** when using JSON mode, you **must** also instruct the model
                    to produce JSON yourself via a system or user message. Without this, the
                    model may generate an unending stream of whitespace until the generation
                    reaches the token limit, resulting in a long-running and seemingly "stuck"
                    request. Also note that the message content may be partially cut off if
                    `finish_reason="length"`, which indicates the generation exceeded
                    `max_tokens` or the conversation exceeded the max context length.

                      Controls which (if any) function is called by the model.
                      `none` means the model will not call a function and instead generates a
                      message.
                      `auto` means the model can pick between generating a message or calling a
                      function.
                      Specifying a particular function via `{"name": "my_function"}` forces the
                      model to call that function.
                      `none` is the default when no functions are present. `auto` is the default
                      if functions are present.

                      Accepts a JSON object that maps tokens (specified by their token ID in the GPT tokenizer) to an associated bias value from -100 to 100. You can use this [tokenizer tool](/tokenizer?view=bpe) to convert text to token IDs. Mathematically, the bias is added to the logits generated by the model prior to sampling. The exact effect will vary per model, but values between -1 and 1 should decrease or increase likelihood of selection; values like -100 or 100 should result in a ban or exclusive selection of the relevant token.
                      As an example, you can pass `{"50256": -100}` to prevent the <|endoftext|> token from being generated.

        An evaluation is a set of testing criteria and a datasource. After
        creating an evaluation, you can run it on different models and model
        parameters. We support several types of graders and datasources.

        Setting to `{ "type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {...} }` enables Structured Outputs which ensures the model will match your supplied JSON schema. Learn more in the [Structured Outputs guide](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/structured-outputs).
        Setting to `{ "type": "json_object" }` enables JSON mode, which ensures the message the model generates is valid JSON.
        *Important:** when using JSON mode, you **must** also instruct the model to produce JSON yourself via a system or user message. Without this, the model may generate an unending stream of whitespace until the generation reaches the token limit, resulting in a long-running and seemingly "stuck" request. Also note that the message content may be partially cut off if `finish_reason="length"`, which indicates the generation exceeded `max_tokens` or the conversation exceeded the max context length.

        Controls which (if any) tool is called by the model.
        `none` means the model will not call any tools and instead generates a message.
        `auto` is the default value and means the model can pick between generating a message or calling one or more tools.
        `required` means the model must call one or more tools before responding to the user.
        Specifying a particular tool like `{"type": "file_search"}` or `{"type": "function", "function": {"name": "my_function"}}` forces the model to call that tool.

            When true, stream obfuscation will be enabled. Stream obfuscation adds
              random characters to an `obfuscation` field on streaming delta events to
              normalize payload sizes as a mitigation to certain side-channel attacks.
              These obfuscation fields are included by default, but add a small amount
              of overhead to the data stream. You can set `include_obfuscation` to
              false to optimize for bandwidth if you trust the network links between
              your application and the OpenAI API.

            The two categories of tools you can provide the model are:

            - **Built-in tools**: Tools that are provided by OpenAI that extend the
              model's capabilities, like file search.
            - **Function calls (custom tools)**: Functions that are defined by you,
              enabling the model to call your own code.

        When the number of tokens in a conversation exceeds the model's input token limit, the conversation be truncated, meaning messages (starting from the oldest) will not be included in the model's context. A 32k context model with 4,096 max output tokens can only include 28,224 tokens in the context before truncation occurs.
        Clients can configure truncation behavior to truncate with a lower max token limit, which is an effective way to control token usage and cost.
        Truncation will reduce the number of cached tokens on the next turn (busting the cache), since messages are dropped from the beginning of the context. However, clients can also configure truncation to retain messages up to a fraction of the maximum context size, which will reduce the need for future truncations and thus improve the cache rate.
        Truncation can be disabled entirely, which means the server will never truncate but would instead return an error if the conversation exceeds the model's input token limit.

        Constrains effort on reasoning for
        [reasoning models](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/reasoning).
        Currently supported values are `none`, `minimal`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, and `xhigh`. Reducing
        reasoning effort can result in faster responses and fewer tokens used
        on reasoning in a response.
        - `gpt-5.1` defaults to `none`, which does not perform reasoning. The supported reasoning values for `gpt-5.1` are `none`, `low`, `medium`, and `high`. Tool calls are supported for all reasoning values in gpt-5.1.
        - All models before `gpt-5.1` default to `medium` reasoning effort, and do not support `none`.
        - The `gpt-5-pro` model defaults to (and only supports) `high` reasoning effort.
        - `xhigh` is supported for all models after `gpt-5.1-codex-max`.

        We support the following categories of tools:
        - **Built-in tools**: Tools that are provided by OpenAI that extend the
        model's capabilities, like [web search](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/tools-web-search)
        or [file search](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/tools-file-search). Learn more about
        [built-in tools](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/tools).
        - **MCP Tools**: Integrations with third-party systems via custom MCP servers
        or predefined connectors such as Google Drive and SharePoint. Learn more about
        [MCP Tools](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/tools-connectors-mcp).
        - **Function calls (custom tools)**: Functions that are defined by you,
        enabling the model to call your own code with strongly typed arguments
        and outputs. Learn more about
        [function calling](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling). You can also use
        custom tools to call your own code.
