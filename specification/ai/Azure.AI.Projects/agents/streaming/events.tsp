  Each event in a server-sent events stream has an `event` and `data` property:
  
  ```
  event: thread.created
  data: {"id": "thread_123", "object": "thread", ...}
  ```
  
  We emit events whenever a new object is created, transitions to a new state, or is being
  streamed in parts (deltas). For example, we emit `thread.run.created` when a new run
  is created, `thread.run.completed` when a run completes, and so on. When an Agent chooses
  to create a message during a run, we emit a `thread.message.created event`, a
  `thread.message.in_progress` event, many `thread.message.delta` events, and finally a
  `thread.message.completed` event.
  
  We may add additional events over time, so we recommend handling unknown events gracefully
  in your code.
