 *
 * **Important:** when using JSON mode, you **must** also instruct the model to produce JSON yourself via a system or user message.
 * Without this, the model may generate an unending stream of whitespace until the generation reaches the token limit,
 * resulting in a long-running and seemingly "stuck" request. Also note that the message content may be partially cut off
 * if `finish_reason="length"`, which indicates the generation exceeded `max_tokens` or the conversation exceeded the max context length.
