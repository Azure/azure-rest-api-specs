The conjecture states that the Riemann zeta function has its zeros only at the negative even integers and complex numbers with real part 1/21. Many consider it to be the most important unsolved problem in pure mathematics. The Riemann hypothesis is a way to predict the probability that numbers in a certain range are prime that was also devised by German mathematician Bernhard Riemann in 18594."
