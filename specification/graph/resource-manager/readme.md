## Configuration

### Basic Information

These are the global settings for the Graph API.

``` yaml

description: Graph Client
openapi-type: arm
tag: package-1.0
```


### Tag: package-1.0

These settings apply only when `--tag=package-1.0` is specified on the command line.

```yaml $(tag) == 'package-1.0'
input-file:
  - Microsoft.Graph/preview/1.0/graph.json
  - Microsoft.Graph/preview/1.0/guest.json
```

# Code Generation

## Swagger to SDK

This section describes what SDK should be generated by the automatic system.
This is not used by Autorest itself.

``` yaml $(swagger-to-sdk)
swagger-to-sdk:
  - repo: azure-sdk-for-go
```
