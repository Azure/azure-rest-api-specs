Note that it is up to the user to correctly handle failures when re-issuing a request. For example, you should use the same Task IDs during a retry so that if the prior operation succeeded, the retry will not create extra Tasks unexpectedly. If the response contains any Tasks which failed to add, a client can retry the request. In a retry, it is most efficient to resubmit only Tasks that failed to add, and to omit Tasks that were successfully added on the first attempt. The maximum lifetime of a Task from addition to completion is 180 days. If a Task has not completed within 180 days of being added it will be terminated by the Batch service and left in whatever state it was in at that time.",

The Compute Node remains ineligible to run Tasks of this Job until it is reimaged. The Compute Node remains active and can be used for other Jobs. The Job Preparation Task can run multiple times on the same Node. Therefore, you should write the Job Preparation Task to handle re-execution. If the Node is rebooted, the Job Preparation Task is run again on the Compute Node before scheduling any other Task of the Job, if rerunOnNodeRebootAfterSuccess is true or if the Job Preparation Task did not previously complete. If the Node is reimaged, the Job Preparation Task is run again before scheduling any Task of the Job. Batch will retry Tasks when a recovery operation is triggered on a Node. Examples of recovery operations include (but are not limited to) when an unhealthy Node is rebooted or a Compute Node disappeared due to host failure. Retries due to recovery operations are independent of and are not counted against the maxTaskRetryCount. Even if the maxTaskRetryCount is 0, an internal retry due to a recovery operation may occur. Because of this, all Tasks should be idempotent. This means Tasks need to tolerate being interrupted and restarted without causing any corruption or duplicate data. The best practice for long running Tasks is to use some form of checkpointing.",
