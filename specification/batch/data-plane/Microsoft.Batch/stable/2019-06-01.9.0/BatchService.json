Because running Tasks are requeued, the user can rerun these Tasks by updating their Job to target a different Pool. The Tasks can then run on the new Pool. If you want to override the requeue behavior, then you should call resize Pool explicitly to shrink the Pool to zero size before deleting the Pool.

Note that it is up to the user to correctly handle failures when re-issuing a request. For example, you should use the same Task IDs during a retry so that if the prior operation succeeded, the retry will not create extra Tasks unexpectedly. If the response contains any Tasks which failed to add, a client can retry the request. In a retry, it is most efficient to resubmit only Tasks that failed to add, and to omit Tasks that were successfully added on the first attempt. The maximum lifetime of a Task from addition to completion is 180 days. If a Task has not completed within 180 days of being added it will be terminated by the Batch service and left in whatever state it was in at that time.",

The specified subnet should have enough free IP addresses to accommodate the number of Compute Nodes which will run Tasks from the Job. This can be up to the number of Compute Nodes in the Pool. The 'MicrosoftAzureBatch' service principal must have the 'Classic Virtual Machine Contributor' Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) role for the specified VNet so that Azure Batch service can schedule Tasks on the Nodes. This can be verified by checking if the specified VNet has any associated Network Security Groups (NSG). If communication to the Nodes in the specified subnet is denied by an NSG, then the Batch service will set the state of the Compute Nodes to unusable. This is of the form /subscriptions/{subscription}/resourceGroups/{group}/providers/{provider}/virtualNetworks/{network}/subnets/{subnet}. If the specified VNet has any associated Network Security Groups (NSG), then a few reserved system ports must be enabled for inbound communication from the Azure Batch service.

Port 443 is also required to be open for outbound connections for communications to Azure Storage.

When a Job Manager Task fails and needs to be restarted, the system tries to schedule it at the highest priority. If there are no idle Compute Nodes available, the system may terminate one of the running Tasks in the Pool and return it to the queue in order to make room for the Job Manager Task to restart. Note that a Job Manager Task in one Job does not have priority over Tasks in other Jobs. Across Jobs, only Job level priorities are observed. For example, if a Job Manager in a priority 0 Job needs to be restarted, it will not displace Tasks of a priority 1 Job. Batch will retry Tasks when a recovery operation is triggered on a Node. Examples of recovery operations include (but are not limited to) when an unhealthy Node is rebooted or a Compute Node disappeared due to host failure. Retries due to recovery operations are independent of and are not counted against the maxTaskRetryCount. Even if the maxTaskRetryCount is 0, an internal retry due to a recovery operation may occur.

If you reimage a Node after it has run the Job Preparation Task, and the Job ends without any further Tasks of the Job running on that Node (and hence the Job Preparation Task does not re-run), then the Job Release Task does not run on that Compute Node. If a Node reboots while the Job Release Task is still running, the Job Release Task runs again when the Compute Node starts up. The Job is not marked as complete until all Job Release Tasks have completed. The Job Release Task runs in the background. It does not occupy a scheduling slot; that is, it does not count towards the maxTasksPerNode limit specified on the Pool."

          "description": "The virtual network must be in the same region and subscription as the Azure Batch Account. The specified subnet should have enough free IP addresses to accommodate the number of Compute Nodes in the Pool. If the subnet doesn't have enough free IP addresses, the Pool will partially allocate Nodes, and a resize error will occur. The 'MicrosoftAzureBatch' service principal must have the 'Classic Virtual Machine Contributor' Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) role for the specified VNet. The specified subnet must allow communication from the Azure Batch service to be able to schedule Tasks on the Nodes. This can be verified by checking if the specified VNet has any associated Network Security Groups (NSG). If communication to the Nodes in the specified subnet is denied by an NSG, then the Batch service will set the state of the Compute Nodes to unusable. For Pools created with virtualMachineConfiguration only ARM virtual networks ('Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks') are supported, but for Pools created with cloudServiceConfiguration both ARM and classic virtual networks are supported. If the specified VNet has any associated Network Security Groups (NSG), then a few reserved system ports must be enabled for inbound communication. For Pools created with a virtual machine configuration, enable ports 29876 and 29877, as well as port 22 for Linux and port 3389 for Windows. For Pools created with a cloud service configuration, enable ports 10100, 20100, and 30100. Also enable outbound connections to Azure Storage on port 443.
