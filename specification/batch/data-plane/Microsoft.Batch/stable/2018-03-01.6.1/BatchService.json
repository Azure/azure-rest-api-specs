Because running tasks are requeued, the user can rerun these tasks by updating their job to target a different pool. The tasks can then run on the new pool.

Although the Batch service tries to avoid upgrading all compute nodes at the same time, it does not guarantee to do this (particularly on small pools); therefore, the pool may be temporarily unavailable to run tasks. When this operation runs, the pool state changes to upgrading. When all compute nodes have finished upgrading, the pool state returns to active. While the upgrade is in progress, the pool's currentOSVersion reflects the OS version that nodes are upgrading from, and targetOSVersion reflects the OS version that nodes are upgrading to. Once the upgrade is complete, currentOSVersion is updated to reflect the OS version now running on all nodes.

Note that it is up to the user to correctly handle failures when re-issuing a request. For example, you should use the same task IDs during a retry so that if the prior operation succeeded, the retry will not create extra tasks unexpectedly. If the response contains any tasks which failed to add, a client can retry the request. In a retry, it is most efficient to resubmit only tasks that failed to add, and to omit tasks that were successfully added on the first attempt.

When a Job Manager task fails and needs to be restarted, the system tries to schedule it at the highest priority. If there are no idle nodes available, the system may terminate one of the running tasks in the pool and return it to the queue in order to make room for the Job Manager task to restart. Note that a Job Manager task in one job does not have priority over tasks in other jobs. Across jobs, only job level priorities are observed. For example, if a Job Manager in a priority 0 job needs to be restarted, it will not displace tasks of a priority 1 job. Batch will retry tasks when a recovery operation is triggered on a compute node. Examples of recovery operations include (but are not limited to) when an unhealthy compute node is rebooted or a compute node disappeared due to host failure. Retries due to recovery operations are independent of and are not counted against the maxTaskRetryCount. Even if the maxTaskRetryCount is 0, an internal retry due to a recovery operation may occur.

If the filename contains a wildcard character it can be escaped using brackets (for example abc[*] would match a file named abc*).
