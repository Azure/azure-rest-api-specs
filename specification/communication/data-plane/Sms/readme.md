## Configuration

### Basic Information

These are the global settings for the communicationservices.

```yaml
openapi-type: data-plane
tag: package-sms-2025-08-01-preview
```

### Supression
``` yaml
suppressions:
 - code: LroExtension
   from: communicationservicessms.json
   reason: Lro attribute was not part of any previous version. Trying to add it signals breaking changes and requires adding operation-location, etc.
 - code: XmsEnumValidation
   from: communicationservicessms.json
   reason: In the stable version repeatabilityResult has enum with accepted/rejected. Also SDK generation of SmsSendResponseItemRepeatabilityResult will fail without it.
```
