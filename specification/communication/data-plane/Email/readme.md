# Code Generation

## Swagger to SDK

This section describes what SDK should be generated by the automatic system.
This is not used by Autorest itself.

## CSharp

See configuration in [readme.csharp.md](./readme.csharp.md)

## Suppression

``` yaml
directive:
  - suppress: DefinitionsPropertiesNamesCamelCase
    from: CommunicationServicesEmail.json
    where: $.definitions.EmailRecipients.properties.CC
    reason: Linter enforcement of this rule (camelCase) for two-letter acronyms conflicts with the description in the rule (all capitalized).
```
