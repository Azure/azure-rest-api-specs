However, the blob service retains the blob or snapshot for the number of days specified by the DeleteRetentionPolicy section of [Storage service properties] (Set-Blob-Service-Properties.md). After the specified number of days has passed, the blob's data is permanently removed from the storage account. Note that you continue to be charged for the soft-deleted blob's storage until it is permanently removed. Use the List Blobs API and specify the \\\"include=deleted\\\" query parameter to discover which blobs and snapshots have been soft deleted. You can then use the Undelete Blob API to restore a soft-deleted blob. All other operations on a soft-deleted blob or snapshot causes the service to return an HTTP status code of 404 (ResourceNotFound).",
