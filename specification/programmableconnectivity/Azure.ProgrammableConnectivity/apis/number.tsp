  Number operations include Frontend Authentication.

  This means that each operation has 2 responses.

  The first response is a 302 redirect, which redirects the device to the device's Network
  to authenticate directly. The Network responds with another 302 redirect and a token.
  This redirects the device to APC, where the token is used to verify / retrieve
  the device number. The second response is a 200 containing the result of the query.

  This flow takes place automatically without user interaction, and so only the result
  of the entire flow (the 200 response) is included in this document.
