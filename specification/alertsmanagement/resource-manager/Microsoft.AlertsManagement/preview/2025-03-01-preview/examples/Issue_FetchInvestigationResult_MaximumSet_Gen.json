              "title": "Network connectivity issues and performance bottlenecks detected",
              "whatHappened": "The investigation target resource 'Draft-INT' of type 'Application Insights' is experiencing multiple issues. In terms of performance, there are spikes in failed requests and server response times, indicating potential service degradation. Reliability concerns are highlighted by increased dependency call failures and durations, suggesting issues with external resource interactions. Additionally, abnormal events in logs point to failures in data retrieval from cache, issues with Managed Service Identity token retrieval, and network connectivity problems, including forcibly closed connections. These incidents impact the application's availability and could lead to a degraded user experience.\n",
              "possibleExplanation": "1. The observed increase in 'Failed requests' along with 'Server response time' might indicate a degradation of the backend service or an infrastructure issue affecting the 'commoninfra-int-bl-0-eus' role instance. This could be corroborated by the logs mentioning 'GatewayTimeout' and 'ECONNRESET', which suggest problems with network connectivity or the upstream services, potentially resulting in timed-out or reset connections. Additionally, the reported issues with 'blobServiceInitializer' and 'MsiTokenHandler' point to difficulties with accessing or authentication within Azure Blob Storage, which may be contributing factors to the failed requests and slow server responses.\n\n2. The spikes in 'Dependency calls' and 'Dependency duration' accompanied by timeouts in 'Redis eval' and promises suggest that there could be performance bottlenecks or high latencies in external dependencies, such as Redis and the 'oiinteusnoop01.eastus.kusto.windows.net' service. These performance issues seem to stem from heavy load or inefficient caching mechanisms, as timeouts in data retrieval operations were indicated. Furthermore, the 'aggregateauthenticationerror' suggests widespread authentication failures, possibly due to configuration issues or unavailable endpoints, which could also result in failed external calls and increased latency application-wide.\n",
              "whatCanBeDoneNext": "- Investigate the 'commoninfra-int-bl-0-eus' role instance for any infrastructure issues by checking the Azure Monitor for any alerts or notifications related to the role instance health, and review the activity logs for any recent changes or updates that could have impacted its performance.\n- Review the Azure Blob Storage access and authentication logs for 'blobServiceInitializer' and 'MsiTokenHandler' to identify any access issues or authentication failures, and verify the storage account configurations to ensure they are correct and the services are operational.\n- Analyze the dependency telemetry in Application Insights for 'Redis eval' and 'oiinteusnoop01.eastus.kusto.windows.net' to identify patterns or trends that could indicate performance bottlenecks or inefficiencies, and consider implementing or adjusting caching strategies to alleviate load.\n- Check for any recent changes in authentication configurations that might have caused the 'aggregateauthenticationerror', and validate the availability and correctness of endpoints that the application relies on for authentication.\n- Given the information about HTTP 502 and 503 responses, ensure that server-side monitoring is enabled and properly configured in Application Insights to capture these errors, and cross-reference with web server logs to confirm the occurrence and source of these errors.\n"
