## Configuration

### Basic Information

These are the global settings for the loadtestservice.

```yaml
openapi-type: data-plane
tag: package-2022-11-01
title: LoadTestingClient
```
### Tag: package-2025-07-01-preview
These settings apply only when `--tag=2025-07-01-preview` is specified on the command line.

```yaml $(tag) == 'package-2025-07-01-preview'
input-file:
  - Playwright/preview/2025-07-01-preview/playwright.json
suppressions:
  - code: ValidResponseCodeRequired
    from: playwright.json
    reason: Need 302 response code as a product requirement to redirect the client for script execution on remote browsers provided by the service.
    where:
      - $.paths["/playwrightworkspaces/{workspaceId}/browsers"].get.responses
  - code: SecurityDefinitionDescription
    from: playwright.json
    reason: Seems like a tool bug, as the description is added in the TypeSpec already.
  - code: PathParameterSchema
    from: playwright.json
    reason: No provision to define path parameter schema for custom routes of rpc operations in Typespec.
    where:
      - $.paths["/playwrightworkspaces/{workspaceId}/browsers"].get.parameters[1]
  - code: SchemaTypeAndFormat
    from: playwright.json
    reason: Seems like a tool bug, as it mentions string has unrecognized format: arm-id generated by TypeSpec.
    where:
      - $.paths["/playwrightworkspaces/{workspaceId}"].get.responses
  - code: OperationId
    from: playwright.json
    reason: Inconsistency with Typespec nomenclature to use create and replace for put while update is used for patch api.
    where:
      - $.paths["/playwrightworkspaces/{workspaceId}/access-tokens/{accessTokenId}"].put.operationId
```
