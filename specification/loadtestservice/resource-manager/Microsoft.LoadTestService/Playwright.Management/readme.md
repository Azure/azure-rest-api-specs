## Configuration

### Basic Information

These are the global settings for Microsoft Playwright Service.

```yaml
title: PlaywrightServiceClient
description: Microsoft Playwright Service Client
openapi-type: arm
openapi-subtype: rpaas
tag: package-2025-07-01-preview
```

### Tag: package-2025-07-01-preview
These settings apply only when `--tag=2025-07-01-preview` is specified on the command line.

```yaml $(tag) == 'package-2025-07-01-preview'
input-file:
  - preview/2025-07-01-preview/playwright.json
suppressions:
  - code: PatchBodyParametersSchema
    from: playwright.json
    reason: Seems like a tool bug, as the operations are generated automatically from the TrackedResourceOperations in the TypeSpec which should OmitDefaults for Patch. We want the default property values to be visible for other operations like Put and Get if they're not explicitly set by the end-user.
  - code: DeleteResponseCodes
    from: playwright.json
    reason: Seems like a tool bug, as default operations with codes are generated from the TrackedResourceOperations in the TypeSpec.
    where:
      - $.paths["/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.LoadTestService/playwrightWorkspaces/{playwrightWorkspaceName}"].delete
```

``` yaml
modelerfour:
  flatten-models: false
```
