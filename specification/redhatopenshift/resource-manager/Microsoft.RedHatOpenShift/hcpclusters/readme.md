# RedHatOpenShift HCP Clusters

> see https://aka.ms/autorest


## This is the autorest configuration file for RedHatOpenShift HCP Clusters.

The service is hosted under Microsoft.RedHatOpenShift namespace but HCP is exposed
as a separarate set of resources, APIs and SDKs.

## Getting Started

To build the SDK for ContainerServices, [install Autorest](https://aka.ms/autorest/install). Then
in this folder, run this command:

> `autorest`

To see additional help and options, run:

> `autorest --help`

---

## Configuration

### Basic Information

These are the global settings for the ContainerServices API.

``` yaml
openapi-type: arm
tag: package-2024-06-10-preview
```

### Tag: package-2024-06-10-preview

These settings apply only when `--tag=package-2024-06-10-preview` is specified on the command line.

``` yaml $(tag) == 'package-2024-06-10-preview'
input-file:
  - 2024-06-10-preview/openapi.json
```

# Code Generation

## Swagger to SDK

This section describes what SDK should be generated by the automatic system.
This is not used by Autorest itself.

``` yaml $(swagger-to-sdk)
swagger-to-sdk:
  - repo: azure-sdk-for-python
  - repo: azure-sdk-for-go
  - repo: azure-resource-manager-schemas
  - repo: azure-powershell
```

<!-- ## Suppression -->

<!-- ### AutoRest v3 Suppressions -->
``` yaml
suppressions:
    - code: AvoidAnonymousTypes
      from: openapi.json
      where: $.definitions["Azure.ResourceManager.CommonTypes.ManagedServiceIdentityUpdate"].properties.userAssignedIdentities.additionalProperties
      reasons: This is an incorrect failure due to a bug in the tool
      # https://github.com/Azure/typespec-azure/issues/1163
    - code: AvoidAdditionalProperties
      from: openapi.json
      where: $.definitions.UserAssignedIdentitiesProfile.properties.controlPlaneOperators
      reasons: This is a Record<UserAssignedIdentityResourceId> where the string keys are control plane operator names. The intention is to pair a control plane operator with a user-assigned managed identity resource ID. The set of valid control plane operator names varies by OpenShift version, and will be discoverable through a forthcoming proxy resource that models a supported OpenShift version.
    - code: AvoidAdditionalProperties
      from: openapi.json
      where: $.definitions.UserAssignedIdentitiesProfile.properties.dataPlaneOperators
      reasons: This is a Record<UserAssignedIdentityResourceId> where the string keys are data plane operator names. The intention is to pair a data plane operator with a user-assigned managed identity resource ID. The set of valid data plane operator names varies by OpenShift version, and will be discoverable through a forthcoming proxy resource that models a supported OpenShift version.
