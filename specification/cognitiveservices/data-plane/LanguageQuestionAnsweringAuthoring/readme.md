# Cognitive Services Language - Question Answering SDK

This is the AutoRest configuration file the Cognitive Services Language - Question Answering SDK.

> see https://aka.ms/autorest

## SDK package updates

The authoring client continues to ship from the existing .NET package `Azure.AI.Language.QuestionAnswering`. Inference models and clients now live in the companion package `Azure.AI.Language.QuestionAnswering.Inference`, and the original package type-forwards those types so existing code keeps working after the split.

## Releases

The current preview release of Language is 2025-05-15-preview.

The current stable release of Language is 2024-04-01.
