                    The prompt(s) to generate completions for, encoded as a string or array of strings.
                    Note that <|endoftext|> is the document separator that the model sees during training, so if a prompt is not specified the model will generate as if from the beginning of a new document. Maximum allowed size of string list is 2048.

                    What sampling temperature to use. Higher values means the model will take more risks. Try 0.9 for more creative applications, and 0 (argmax sampling) for ones with a well-defined answer.
                    We generally recommend altering this or top_p but not both.

                  description: |-
                    An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the model considers the results of the tokens with top_p probability mass. So 0.1 means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered.
                    We generally recommend altering this or temperature but not both.
                  type: number

                logit_bias:
                  description: Defaults to null. Modify the likelihood of specified tokens appearing in the completion. Accepts a json object that maps tokens (specified by their token ID in the GPT tokenizer) to an associated bias value from -100 to 100. You can use this tokenizer tool (which works for both GPT-2 and GPT-3) to convert text to token IDs. Mathematically, the bias is added to the logits generated by the model prior to sampling. The exact effect will vary per model, but values between -1 and 1 should decrease or increase likelihood of selection; values like -100 or 100 should result in a ban or exclusive selection of the relevant token. As an example, you can pass {"50256" &#58; -100} to prevent the <|endoftext|> token from being generated.

                    Generates best_of completions server-side and returns the "best" (the one with the highest log probability per token). Results cannot be streamed.
                    When used with n, best_of controls the number of candidate completions and n specifies how many to return - best_of must be greater than n.
