``` yaml $(tag) == 'release_2_0'
input-file: stable/v2.0/speechtotext.json
```

AutoRest-Linter Suppressions

# Ignore autorest-linter issues that cannot be resolve without updates to the API implementation

    reason: Changing casing will break existing clients/consumers
```

## SpeechToText 3.0
These settings apply only when `--tag=release_3_0` is specified on the command line.

``` yaml $(tag) == 'release_3_0'
input-file: stable/v3.0/speechtotext.json
```

AutoRest-Linter Suppressions

``` yaml
# Ignore autorest-linter issues that cannot be resolve without updates to the API implementation
directive:
  - suppress: LongRunningOperationsWithLongRunningExtension
    reason: Does not apply in those two places. The method is a DELETE which lazily deletes blobs, so it's Accepted, not NoContent. 
```

## SpeechToText 3.1-preview.1
These settings apply only when `--tag=release_3_1_preview_1` is specified on the command line.

``` yaml $(tag) == 'release_3_1_preview_1'
input-file: preview/v3.1-preview.1/speechtotext.json
```

directive:
  - suppress: LongRunningOperationsWithLongRunningExtension

  - suppress: OperationIdNounVerb
    where: $..paths[($..operationId["Models_*"])]
    reason: There is a sub-route called /models/base/ that refers to the base models. Therefore, the correct operation ID seems to be "Models_GetBaseModel", for example.
  - suppress: HostParametersValidation
    reason: Existing API, change would potentially be breaking.
```
