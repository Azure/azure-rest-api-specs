    "description": "The Anomaly Detection Service detects anomalies automatically in time series data. It supports two functionalities, one is for detecting the whole series with model trained by the timeseries, another is detecting last point with model trained by points before. By using this service, business customers can discover incidents and establish a logic flow for root cause analysis. Ensure online service quality is one of the main reasons we develop this service. Improving anomaly detection service to provide precise results will always be fundamental work of our team."
