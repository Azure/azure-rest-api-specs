    reason: 'This property is already a part of our API, cannot remove it'
  - suppress: READONLY_PROPERTY_NOT_ALLOWED_IN_REQUEST
    where:
      - $.definitions.Resource.properties.name
      - $.definitions.Resource.properties.id

# Code Generation

## Swagger to SDK

This section describes what SDK should be generated by the automatic system.
This is not used by Autorest itself.

```yaml $(swagger-to-sdk)
swagger-to-sdk:
  - repo: azure-sdk-for-python
  - repo: azure-sdk-for-java
  - repo: azure-sdk-for-go
  - repo: azure-sdk-for-js

### Suppress linting rules

These set of linting rules aren't applicable to the AzureLargeInstance RP so suppressing them here.

``` yaml
suppressions:
  - code: PutResponseCodes
    from: azurelargeinstance.json
    reason: The PUT method only creates resource for the RP. The operation to update an existing instance is unsupported. This is because instances that are 'created' are simply assigned to customers, and have already been provisioned. ARM operations to change the provisioning status of a resource are unsupported.
  - code: DeleteResponseCodes
    from: azurelargeinstance.json
    reason: The DELETE method either removes an instance from the DB or returns an error. Since only one successful outcome is possible, it doesn't make sense for our RP to support both 200 and 204.
  - code: DeleteOperationResponses
    from: azurelargeinstance.json
    reason: Customers deleting resources don't request any new information from the operation besides its result. Therefore it makes sense to return no content when the operation succeeds.
  - code: TrackedResourcesMustHavePut
    where:
      - $.definitions.AzureLargeInstance
      - $.definitions.AzureLargeStorageInstance
    reason: All PUT actions are carried out internally by our specialized team utilizing Geneva actions. This process is not currently available for external use.
```
