# Azure REST API Specifications

## Description

This repository is the canonical source for REST API specifications for Microsoft Azure. You can learn more about it [here](https://eng.ms/docs/products/azure-developer-experience/design/api-specs-pr/api-repos).

## Getting started

If you're a Microsoft employee looking for information about all of the repositories and steps for Azure SDK Libraries Releases, go to the [aka.ms/azsdk/join](https://aka.ms/azsdk/join).

External Contributors can read [Getting Started with OpenAPI Specifications](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/blob/main/documentation/Getting%20started%20with%20OpenAPI%20specifications.md).

<!-- Please check the [announcements page](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/wiki/Announcements) for any new updates since your last visit.-->

### Terminology

- **Offerings**, **Skus**, and **Features** - These are distinct entities represented in Eco Manager and Service Tree.  While the Offering/Sku/Feature entities and hierarchy represent the externally marketed product, **service/components** entities in service tree represent corresponding engineering entities that together power these external products.  Refer to [Product Taxonomy](https://dev.azure.com/msazure/AzureWiki/_wiki/wikis/AzureWiki.wiki/40783/Service-Tree-Product-Taxonomy) for details.

- **Resource Provider** - When a service onboards new functionality onto ARM, it is required to complete [Resource Provider Registration](https://armwiki.azurewebsites.net/rp_onboarding/ResourceProviderRegistration.html).  For existing **Resource Provider to Service Mapping**, refer to [Match resource provider to service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/azure-services-resource-providers#match-resource-provider-to-service)*

## Directory Structure

See [aka.ms/azsdk/spec-dirs](https://aka.ms/azsdk/spec-dirs).

## Next steps

The next step in the process after a spec is completed is to generate SDKs and API reference documentation. If you're a Microsoft employee, go to the [Azure SDK - Internal Wiki](https://aka.ms/jointhesdk) for more information.
