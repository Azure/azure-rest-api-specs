  Author or modify Azure TypeSpec API specifications in the azure-rest-api-specs repository.
  USE FOR: Any task that creates, modifies, or troubleshoots .tsp files or TypeSpec API specifications — including but not limited to API versioning, ARM or data-plane resource definitions (tracked, proxy, extension, child resources), resource operations (CRUD, PATCH, custom actions, async/LRO), models, enums, unions, properties, decorators, constraints, and swagger-to-TypeSpec conversion.
  DO NOT USE FOR: SDK generation from TypeSpec, releasing SDK packages, single MCP tool calls that do not require multi-step workflows.
  TOOLS/COMMANDS: azsdk_typespec_generate_authoring_plan, azsdk_run_typespec_validation

# Azure TypeSpec Author

## MCP Tools

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `azsdk_typespec_generate_authoring_plan` | Generate a grounded authoring plan for TypeSpec changes based on user request and existing code |
| `azsdk_run_typespec_validation` | Run TypeSpec compilation and lint validation after edits |

---

## Operating Principles

> **Non-negotiable** — all principles below apply to every invocation of this skill.

1. **This skill is MANDATORY for ALL `.tsp` file edits.** Any request that modifies, creates, or deletes content in a `.tsp` file MUST follow the full workflow — regardless of how simple the change appears. There are no "trivial" TypeSpec edits. Even changing a single `?` (optional → required) can be a breaking change requiring versioning decorators.
2. **Do not edit any files until you have required inputs and have retrieved a solution.** Use the `azsdk_typespec_generate_authoring_plan` MCP tool.
3. **Make minimal, scoped edits** to satisfy the request. Avoid refactors unless explicitly asked.
4. **After edits, validate** (compile / lint / emitter checks if available) and report results.
5. **Always provide references** (titles / sections / links) from retrieved context that justify the recommended approach.

---

## Workflow Steps

> **All 6 steps are MANDATORY. Do NOT skip any step.**

| Step | Name | Tool / File | Gate |
|------|------|-------------|------|
| 1 | [Intake & Clarification](#step-1-intake--clarification) | `intake-arm.md` | All inputs collected + analysis displayed |
| 2 | [Retrieve Solution](#step-2-retrieve-solution) | `azsdk_typespec_generate_authoring_plan` | Grounded plan returned |
| 3 | [Apply Changes](#step-3-apply-changes) | Editor | User confirms uncertainties |
| 4 | [Validate](#step-4-validate) | `azsdk_run_typespec_validation` | Compilation passes |
| 5 | [Summarize](#step-5-summarize) | — | Summary displayed to user |
| 6 | [Next Steps](#step-6-next-steps) | `next-steps-arm.md` | Follow-up actions presented |

---

### Step 1: Intake & Clarification

Follow `intake-arm.md` to gather all required inputs.

> **⚠️ CRITICAL**: Step 1 includes a **mandatory sub-step (Step 1.3)** that requires you to display the **📊 TypeSpec Project Analysis** summary in the chat. You **MUST** output this analysis before proceeding. Do **NOT** skip Step 1.3 or jump ahead to Step 2 without first displaying the analysis results to the user. This is a hard requirement — no exceptions.

Do NOT proceed to Step 2 until all required inputs are collected **and** the analysis output has been displayed.

---

### Step 2: Retrieve Solution

Invoke `azsdk_typespec_generate_authoring_plan` MCP tool:

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| `request` | User request (verbatim) |
| `additionalInformation` | Relevant `.tsp` code read from the project |
| `typeSpecProjectRootPath` | TypeSpec project root path |

Do NOT proceed to Step 3 without a grounded plan from this tool.

---

### Step 3: Apply Changes

Only after a grounded plan is produced:

1. Confirm with user if any uncertainties remain
2. Make the minimal changes required in the relevant `.tsp` files
3. Prefer the official template/pattern from retrieved context even if the repo has older patterns

---

### Step 4: Validate

Invoke `azsdk_run_typespec_validation` MCP tool to run validation.

- If validation **passes** → proceed to Step 5
- If validation **fails** → fix forward with minimal changes and re-validate
- Do NOT skip validation even if the change appears trivial

---

### Step 5: Summarize

Return the following to the user:

| Item | Detail |
|------|--------|
| **Files changed** | List of modified files |
| **What changed** | Brief description of changes and rationale |
| **Validation results** | Pass/fail + key output |
| **References** | Titles/sections/links from the azure-sdk-mcp/azsdk_typespec_generate_authoring_plan tool response (do not omit this even for small or trivial changes) that justify decisions |

---

### Step 6: Next Steps

Read the file `next-steps-arm.md` (using the read_file tool) and execute **ALL** of its instructions.

> **Do NOT** summarize and end your turn without presenting the follow-up actions from `next-steps-arm.md` to the user. The user must be given the opportunity to request additional changes.
