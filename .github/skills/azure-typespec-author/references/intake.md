# Intake

> Prerequisite: Step 1 (Analyze Project) must be complete.

## 2.1 General Intake (All Cases)

1. Run [agentic search](agentic-search.md) using the Step 1 result and the user's request.
2. Identify the case from the table below and gather more information if case matches. If no case matches, skip Step 2.2.

| Case | Name                    | Description                                           | Service Type |
| ---- | ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| 1    | Add Resource Type       | Define a new ARM resource with operations             | ARM          |
| 2    | Add Resource Operations | Add CRUD or custom actions on an existing resource    | ARM          |
| 3    | API Version Evolution   | Add, bump, or promote an API version (preview/stable) | ARM          |

## 2.2 Case-Specific Intake

### Case 1 — Add Resource Type (ARM)

Collect: target API version, resource name (PascalCase), hierarchy (top-level or nested + parent), properties (name, type, required/optional).

Defaults: top-level → `TrackedResource`, child → `ProxyResource`. Operations: `createOrReplace` (PUT/async), `get`, `update/patch`, `delete` (async), list by parent. Top-level adds list by subscription.

> Use `createOrReplace` (not `createOrUpdate`). Use `ArmCustomPatch` for PATCH.
> Top-level tracked resources MUST have `listByResourceGroup` and `listBySubscription`.

### Case 2 — Add Resource Operations (ARM)

Collect: target resource, operation type (CRUD or custom), operation name (custom actions), request/response models (custom actions).

Defaults: never async → GET, LIST, HEAD. Default async → PUT, DELETE. Default sync → PATCH. Always ask user → POST/action.

> Use `createOrReplace` (not `createOrUpdate`). Use `ArmCustomPatch` for PATCH.
> For async POST, use ARM combined headers: `LroHeaders = ArmCombinedLroHeaders<FinalResult = ExportResult>`.

### Case 3 — API Version Evolution (ARM)

Collect from user:

1. **Target version** (e.g. `2026-01-01-preview` or `2026-01-01`)
2. **Features to exclude, Do not assume the user wants to carry over all features** — follow this procedure exactly:
   1. Read the latest version's `.tsp` files and enumerate all resources, operations, models, and properties.
   2. Present the list to the user as a numbered checklist.
   3. Ask: _"All features will be carried over to the new version. Are there any you want to exclude? List by number, or say 'none'."_
   4. Wait for the user's response before proceeding.

## 2.3 Confirm

Display and wait for user confirmation:

```
Case:           [Name]
Target Version: [version]
Changes:        [summary]
Defaults:       [applied defaults]
```
