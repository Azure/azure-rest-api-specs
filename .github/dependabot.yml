  # For monorepos, only the root folder should be listed (not the sub-folders).
  # We may also need to set "versioning-strategy" to "increase" rather than "increase-if-necessary",
  # to update both package.json and package-lock.json files.  In our case, we don't really care
  # if the package.json files are updated or not, just that package-lock.json is update.
