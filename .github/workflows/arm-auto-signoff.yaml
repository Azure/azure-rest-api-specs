  # Must run on pull_request_target instead of pull_request, since the latter cannot trigger on
  # labels from bot accounts in fork PRs. pull_request_target is also more similar to the other
  # triggers "issue_comment" and "workflow_run" -- they are all privileged# and run in the target
  # branch and repo -- which simplifies implementation.
