  # Must run on pull_request_target instead of pull_request, since the latter cannot trigger on
  # labels from bot accounts in fork PRs. pull_request_target is also more similar to the other
  # trigger "workflow_run" -- they are both privileged and run in the target branch and repo --
  # which simplifies implementation.
