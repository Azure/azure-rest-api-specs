### Breaking changes review (Diagram Step 1)

If the automation determines you have breaking changes, i.e. Step 1 from the diagram applies to you,
  you must follow the [breaking changes process].  
  **IMPORTANT** This applies even if:
- The tool fails while it shouldn't, e.g. due to runtime exception, or incorrect detection of breaking changes.
- You believe there is no need for you to request breaking change approval, for any reason. 
    Such claims must be reviewed, and the process is the same.
