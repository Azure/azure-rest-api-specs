      Hi @${PRAuthor}! The automation detected breaking changes in this pull request.
      As a result, it added the `BreakingChangeReviewRequired` label.
      <br/><br/>
      You cannot proceed with merging this PR until you complete one of the following action items:
      <br/><br/>
      **ACTION ITEM ALTERNATIVE A**: Fix the breaking change. <br/>
      Please consult the documentation provided in the relevant validation failures.
      <br/><br/>
      **ACTION ITEM ALTERNATIVE B**: Request approval. <br/>
      Alternatively, if you cannot fix the breaking changes, then you can request an approval for them.
      Please follow the process described in the
      [High-level Breaking Change Process doc](https://aka.ms/breakingchangesprocess#high-level-breaking-change-process).
      <br/><br/>
      **ACTION ITEM ALTERNATIVE C**: Report false positive. <br/>
      If you think there are no breaking changes, 
      i.e. the validation should pass yet it fails, 
      then proceed as explained in **ACTION ITEM ALTERNATIVE B**.<br/>
      This applies even if the breaking change tool fails with internal runtime error. 
      In such case a manual breaking change review is necessary.

      Hi @${PRAuthor}! The automation detected this pull request introduces changes
      to at least one existing API version that violate Azure's versioning policy. 
      To comply with the policy, these changes must be made in a new API version.
      As a result, the automation added the `NewApiVersionRequired` label.
      <br/><br/> 
      You cannot proceed with merging this PR until you complete one of the following action items:
      <br/><br/>
      **ACTION ITEM ALTERNATIVE A**: Introduce a new API version. <br/> 
      Submit a new PR instead of this one, or modify this PR, 
      so that it adds a new API version instead of introducing changes to existing API versions.
      <br/><br/>
      **ACTION ITEM ALTERNATIVE B**: Request approval. <br/>
      Alternatively, if you cannot avoid modifying existing API versions, 
      then you can request an approval for them.
      Please follow the process described in the
      [High-level Breaking Change Process doc](https://aka.ms/breakingchangesprocess#high-level-breaking-change-process).
      <br/><br/>
      **ACTION ITEM ALTERNATIVE C**: Report false positive. <br/>
      If you think there are no changes in existing API version, 
      i.e. there should be no `NewApiVersionRequired` label,
      then proceed as explained in **ACTION ITEM ALTERNATIVE B**.<br/>
      This applies even if the breaking change tool fails with internal runtime error. 
      In such case a manual breaking change review is necessary.

      Hi @${PRAuthor}! For review efficiency consideration, 
      when creating a new API version, it is required to place API specs of the 
      base version in the first commit, and push new version updates into successive commits. 
      You can use OpenAPIHub to initialize the PR for adding a new version. <br/>
      For more details refer to the [wiki](https://dev.azure.com/azure-sdk/internal/_wiki/wikis/internal.wiki/208/OpenAPI-Hub-Adding-new-API-version).
