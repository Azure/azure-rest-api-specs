# Goal
- After INSERT_STEP_HERE, validate the service label for the corresponding API spec and create a pull request if necessary. 

## Step 1: Prompt for Service Label
- Ask user if they have a label to their service.

## Step 2: Validate Service Label
- If a label is provided by the user, use `CheckServiceLabel` to validate the service label for the corresponding API spec
    - If the service label is valid and exists, skip remaining label validation steps and allow user to proceed with the SDK release process
- If the service label is invalid or was not provided by the user:
    - If it's invalid, inform the user that the service label is invalid. Ask them to double check spelling, punctuation, and space usage.
    - Use `fetch` to retrieve common-labels.csv file from the azure-sdk-tools repository and check if any existing label could fit under the service. If a related service label name already exists in the file, ask and confirm if the user wants to use that existing label for their service.
        - If the user confirms, use that existing label. Skip remaining label validation steps and proceed with the SDK release process
    - If user wants to create an entirely new service label instead, suggest a label name to the user and have them confirm the recommended label name
        - Service label naming guidance:
            - Use `fetch` to retrieve common-labels.csv file from the azure-sdk-tools repository to find a suitable name
            - Avoid special characters (unless it's a hyphen to denote a sub-service)
            - If multiple words, use spaces to separate them and each word should start with a capital letter
- Make note of the corresponding service label name the user has confirmed or provided

## Step 3: Create Pull Request (only if new service label is created)
- If a new service label was created and confirmed by the user, create a pull request using `CreatePullRequest` that adds the new service label to the common-labels.csv file in the azure-sdk-tools repository
    - Ensure that the pull request:
        - Is in a branch separate from the main branch
        - Inserts the new service label name so that the file maintains alphabetical order
        - Uses "e99695" as the color code for the new service label
- Provide the user with a link to the pull request for review and merging
- Inform the user that they can proceed with the SDK release process once the pull request is merged
