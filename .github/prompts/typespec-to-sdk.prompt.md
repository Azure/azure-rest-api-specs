description: 'Generate SDKs from TypeSpec'
---
Your goal is to guide user through the process of generating SDKs from TypeSpec projects. Show all the high level steps to the user to ensure they understand the flow. Use the provided tools to perform actions and gather information as needed.
## TypeSpec to SDK Generation Process
1. **Pre-Flight Check**: Ensure user is not on main branch and prompt to create a new branch if necessary.
2. **Identify TypeSpec Project**: Locate the TypeSpec project root path by checking for `tspconfig.yaml` or `main.tsp` files.
3. **Validate TypeSpec Specification**: Ensure the TypeSpec specification compiles without errors.
4. **Verify Authentication and Repository Status**: Ensure user is authenticated and working in the correct public Azure repository.
5. **Review and Commit Changes**: Stage and commit TypeSpec modifications, ensuring the current branch is not "main".
6. **Choose SDK Generation Method**: Determine how to generate SDKs (locally or via pipeline).
7. **Create Specification Pull Request**: Create a pull request for TypeSpec changes if not already created.
8. **Verify API Readiness**: Ensure the API specification pull request is ready for SDK generation.
9. **Generate SDKs via Pipeline**: Create a release plan and generate SDKs, monitoring the pipeline status and displaying generated SDK PR links.

## Pre-Flight Check
- Verify ${workspaceFolder} is not on main branch
- If on main branch, prompt user: "You are currently on the main branch. Please create a new branch using `git checkout -b <branch-name>` before proceeding."
- Wait for user confirmation before continuing

## Step 1: Identify TypeSpec Project
**Goal**: Locate the TypeSpec project root path
**Actions**:
1. Check if `tspconfig.yaml` or `main.tsp` files are open in editor
2. If found, use the parent directory as project root
3. If not found, prompt user: "Please provide the path to your TypeSpec project root directory"
4. Validate the provided path contains required TypeSpec files
**Success Criteria**: Valid TypeSpec project path identified

## Step 2: Validate TypeSpec Specification
**Goal**: Ensure TypeSpec specification compiles without errors
**Actions**:
1. Run `/validate-typespec` command
2. If validation succeeds, proceed to Step 3
3. If validation fails:
    - Display all compilation errors to user
    - Prompt: "Please fix the TypeSpec compilation errors before proceeding"
    - Wait for user to fix errors and re-run validation
**Success Criteria**: TypeSpec compilation passes without errors

## Step 3: Verify Authentication and Repository Status
**Goal**: Ensure user is authenticated and working in correct repository
**Actions**:
1. Run `GetGitHubUserDetails` to verify login status
2. If not logged in, prompt: "Please login to GitHub using `gh auth login`"
3. Once logged in, display user details to confirm identity
4. Run `CheckIfSpecInPublicRepo` to verify repository
5. If not in public repo, inform: "Please make spec changes in Azure/azure-rest-api-specs public repo to generate SDKs"
**Success Criteria**: User authenticated and working in public Azure repo

## Step 4: Review and Commit Changes
**Goal**: Stage and commit TypeSpec modifications
**Actions**:
1. Run `GetModifiedTypeSpecProjects` to identify changes
2. If no changes found, inform: "No TypeSpec projects were modified in current branch"
3. Display all modified files (excluding `.github` and `.vscode` folders)
4. Prompt user: "Please review the modified files. Do you want to commit these changes? (yes/no)"
5. If yes:
    - Verify current branch is not "main"
    - Run `git add <modified-files>`
    - Prompt for commit message
    - Run `git commit -m "<user-provided-message>"`
    - Run `git push -u origin <current-branch-name>`
**Success Criteria**: Changes committed and pushed to remote branch

## Step 5: Choose SDK Generation Method
**Goal**: Determine how to generate SDKs
**Actions**:
1. Present options: "How would you like to generate SDKs?"
    - Option A: "Generate SDK locally". This is currently supported only for Python. Do not recommend this for other languages.
    - Option B: "Use SDK generation pipeline"
2. Based on selection:
    - If Option A: Run `/create-sdk-locally` and then proceed to Step 6
    - If Option B: Continue to Step 6
**Success Criteria**: SDK generation method selected

## Step 6: Create Specification Pull Request
**Goal**: Create PR for TypeSpec changes if not already created
**Actions**:
1. Check if spec PR already exists using `GetPullRequestForCurrentBranch`
2. If PR exists, display PR details and proceed to Step 7
3. If no PR exists:
    - Run `/create-spec-pullrequest`
    - Wait for PR creation confirmation
    - Display created PR details
**Success Criteria**: Specification pull request exists

## Step 7: Verify API Readiness
**Goal**: Ensure API specification PR is ready for SDK generation
**Actions**:
1. Run `/check-api-readiness` on the spec PR
2. If ready, proceed to Step 8
3. If not ready:
    - Display specific readiness issues
    - Inform user: "The following actions are required before SDK generation: [list issues]"
    - Wait for user to address issues
**Success Criteria**: API specification PR passes readiness checks

## Step 8: Generate SDKs via Pipeline
**Goal**: Create release plan and generate SDKs
**Actions**:
1. Run `/create-release-plan`
2. If SDK PRs exist, link them to the release plan
3. Run `/sdk-details-in-release-plan` to add languages and package names to the release plan
4. If TypeSpec project is for management plane, Run `/verify-namespace-approval` to check package namespace approval.
This step should not check package readiness to verify namespace approval for management plane SDK.
5. Run `/run-sdk-gen-pipeline` with the spec PR
6. Monitor pipeline status and provide updates
7. Display generated SDK PR links when available
**Success Criteria**: SDK generation pipeline initiated and SDKs generated
