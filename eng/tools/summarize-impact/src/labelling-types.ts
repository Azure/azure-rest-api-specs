/**
 * The LabelContext is used by prSummary.ts / summary() and downstream invocations.
 *
 * The "present" set represents the set of labels that are currently present on the PR
 * processed by given invocation of summary(). It is obtained via GitHub Octokit API at the beginning
 * of summary().
 *
 * The "toAdd" set is the set of labels to be added to the PR at the end of invocation of summary().
 * This is to be done by calling GitHub Octokit API to add the labels.
 *
 * The "toRemove" set is analogous to "toAdd" set, but instead it is the set of labels to be removed.
 *
 * The general pattern used in the code to populate "toAdd" or "toRemove" sets to be ready for
 * Octokit invocation is as follows:
 *
 * - the summary() function passes the context through its invocation chain.
 * - given function responsible for given label, like e.g. for label "ARMReview",
 *   creates a new instance of Label: const armReviewLabel = new Label("ARMReview", labelContext.present)
 * - the function then processes the label to determine if armReviewLabel.shouldBePresent is to be set to true or false.
 * - the function at the end of its invocation calls armReviewLabel.applyStateChanges(labelContext.toAdd, labelContext.toRemove)
 *   to update the sets.
 * - the function may optionally return { armReviewLabel.shouldBePresent } to allow the caller to pass this value
 *   further to downstream business logic that depends on it.
 * - at the end of invocation summary() calls Octokit passing it as input labelContext.toAdd and labelContext.toRemove.
 *
 * todo: this type is duplicated in JSDoc over in summarize-checks.js
