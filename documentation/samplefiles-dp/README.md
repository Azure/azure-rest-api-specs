# Dataplane Swagger Samples

If the swagger will generate sdk with single client, please refer to [dataplane samples for single client](samplefiles-dp-for-single-client). (By default you will always use single client sample.)

If the swagger will generate sdk with multi client, please refer to [dataplane samples for multi client](samplefiles-dp-for-multi-client). (You will only generate multi-client sdk when Arch Board asks you to do it.)
