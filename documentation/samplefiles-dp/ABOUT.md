This `samplefiles-dp` directory contains sample AutoRest configuration files
for data-plane specs: `README.md`.  
It also contains the sample hand-written OpenAPI specification files referenced by these files.

You can learn more about AutoRest configuration files at
[aka.ms/azsdk/autorest](https://aka.ms/azsdk/autorest).

> [!CAUTION]
> The example OpenAPI specification files in this directory are hand-written,
> which is a legacy, obsolete approach. For current approach refer to
> [aka.ms/azsdk/typespec](https://aka.ms/azsdk/typespec).

For a case where a single SDK client is generated,
see [dataplane samples for single client](samplefiles-dp-for-single-client).
This is the default, common scenario.

For a case where a multiple SDK clients are generated, 
see [dataplane samples for multi client](samplefiles-dp-for-multi-client).
This is an advanced scenario. You can learn more about it at
[aka.ms/azsdk/spec-dirs#advanced-scenario-service-group](https://aka.ms/azsdk/spec-dirs#advanced-scenario-service-group).
