This `samplefiles` directory contains sample AutoRest configuration files: 
`README.*.md`. It also contains the sample hand-written OpenAPI 
specification files referenced by these files.

Finally, the `./Microsoft.YourServiceName/stable/YYYY-MM-DD/scenarios/quickStart.yaml`
is an [api-scenario](../api-scenario) sample.

You can learn more about AutoRest configuration files at
[aka.ms/azsdk/autorest](https://aka.ms/azsdk/autorest).

> [!CAUTION]
> The example OpenAPI specification files in this directory are hand-written,
> which is a legacy, obsolete approach. For current approach refer to
> [aka.ms/azsdk/typespec](https://aka.ms/azsdk/typespec).
