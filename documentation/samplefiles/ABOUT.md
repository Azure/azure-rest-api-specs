# About `samplefiles`

This `samplefiles` directory contains sample AutoRest configuration files: 
`README.*.md`. It also contains the sample hand-written OpenAPI 
specification files referenced by the README files.

> [!CAUTION]
> The example OpenAPI specification files in this directory are hand-written,
> which is a legacy, obsolete approach. For current approach refer to
> [aka.ms/azsdk/typespec](https://aka.ms/azsdk/typespec).

Finally, the `./Microsoft.YourServiceName/stable/YYYY-MM-DD/scenarios/quickStart.yaml`
