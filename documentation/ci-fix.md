# CI Fix Guide

Here are guides to fix some of the CI failure.

## Spell check

Please add your words to `./custom-words.txt` if you think you have the correct spell.

If your problem is some existing error name that is not a word and need to supress the error in that file (and don't want to add to custom-words.txt), you can add it to `./cSpell.txt`.

## Prettier check

Please run the following command (from an administrator Node.js command prompt if running on Windows):

```
npm install; npm run prettier-fix
```

Or if you want to fix specified service:

```
npm install; npm run prettier -- --write "specification/<service>/**/*.json"
```

Then please commit and push changes made by prettier.

## Model Validation

```
npm install -g oav
