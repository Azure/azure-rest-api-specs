# CI Fix Guide

Here are guides to fix some of the CI failure.

## Prerequisites

Most guides here require for you to have `npm` installed, which you can get by installing [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download).

## Spell check

Please add your words to `./custom-words.txt` if you think you have the correct spell.

If your problem is some existing error name that is not a word and need to suppress the error in that file (and don't want to add to custom-words.txt), you can add it to `./cSpell.txt`.

## Prettier check

First, ensure you have fulfilled `Prerequisites` as explained above.

To update all the spec files for a given service run the following:

```
# To fix all the files in the repo run from the root of the repo
cd <local_repo_clone_root>

# OPTIONAL STEP: To fix a particular service swagger cd to that directory like
cd specification/contosowidgetmanager

# Install the dependencies to the local 'node_modules' folder.
npm install

# Compile TypeScript. Compilation will fail, this is expected. But it will compile 'scripts/prettier-swagger-plugin', which is what we need.
npx tsc 

# As of 5/25/2023, the prettier version should be 2.1.2
npx prettier --version

# Run 'prettier --check' to verify the problems can be reproduced locally
npx prettier --check **/*.json

# Run 'prettier --list-different' to understand which files have problems.
# Note: there is no way to view the exact problems without actually changing the affected files. See https://github.com/prettier/prettier/issues/6069.
npx prettier --list-different **/*.json

# Run 'prettier --write' to fix the problems.
npx prettier --write **/*.json
```

Then please commit and push changes made by prettier.

## Semantic Validation

Run Semantic Validation locally:
```
npm install -g oav
oav validate-spec <swagger-spec-path>
```
Please see [readme](https://github.com/Azure/oav/blob/bd04e228b4181c53769ed88e561dec5212e77253/README.md) for how to install or run tool in details.

## Breaking Change Check
- An API contract is identified by its api-version value. Once published, no changes to this API contract are allowed. This applies regardless of whether the API contract is for private preview, public preview, or GA (stable).
    - The same-version breaking change linter rules check for changes to an existing api-version swagger.
-	When introducing a new API contract (preview or not), the new API contract must be backwards compatible with the previous GAâ€™s API contract.
   	- However, during a (private or public) preview cycle, a new preview API contract does not have to be backwards compatible with the previous preview API contract although it must still be backwards compatible with the latest GA API contract.
	- The cross version breaking change linter rules checks for this by comparing the new swagger with the latest GA swagger. If there is no latest GA swagger, then the latest preview if it > 1 year old. If nether a GA or preview > 1 year old exists, then the swagger is considered good.

### adding label on PR automatically
The breaking change check has two types of violations: one is breaking change in the same version but not breaking change in a new version, the other is breaking change even in a new version.
For the former, a label 'NewApiVersionRequired' will be added automatically; For the latter , a label 'BreakingChangeReviewRequired' will be added automatically. Adding each label will trigger a github comment with guildance on how to fix.

### run locally
run oad locally (the breaking change is reported by oad tool):
```
npm install -g @azure/oad
oad compare <old-spec-path> <new-spec-path>
```
Please see [readme](https://github.com/Azure/openapi-diff/blob/main/README.md) for how to install or run tool in details.
Or you can run it in [OpenAPI Hub](https://portal.azure-devex-tools.com/tools/diff).
Refer to [Oad Docs](https://github.com/Azure/openapi-diff/tree/main/docs) for detailed description of all oad rules.

## LintDiff Validation

The [LintDiff validation tool](https://github.com/Azure/azure-openapi-validator) runs linting rules against specification difference. Two specifications are compared: the specification as it would be when proposed PR is merged, vs the specification as seen before the PR is merged.

Refer to [openapi-authoring-automated-guidelines](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/blob/master/documentation/openapi-authoring-automated-guidelines.md) for detailed description of all lint rules and how-to-fix guidance.  
If that guidance is not enough, please also refer to the [LintDiff rules.md doc](https://github.com/Azure/azure-openapi-validator/blob/main/docs/rules.md). It links to `.md` files related to given error, containing instructions how to fix them.

To reproduce LintDiff failures locally, see [CONTRIBUTING.md / How to locally reproduce a LintDiff failure occurring on a PR](https://github.com/Azure/azure-openapi-validator/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#how-to-locally-reproduce-a-lintdiff-failure-occurring-on-a-pr).

## Avocado

Run avocado locally:

```
npm install -g @azure/avocado

avocado
```

When type avocado in command line, avocado will validate in the current directory.

Note: When running in Swagger PR pipeline, Avocado only report errors with file updates in the PR, but ignore the errors existing in base. However when running Avocado against local directory, it reports all errors existing in the files.

- Run all specs: Clone the repo `azure/azure-rest-api-specs` and run "avocado" in folder `azure/azure-rest-api-specs`.
- Run single service specs: create a folder `specification`. and move your service specs folder in `specification`. run "avocado"

Refer to [Avocado Readme](https://github.com/Azure/avocado/blob/master/README.md) for detailed description of validations and how-to-fix guidance.

## API Readiness Check

This CI check is to make sure service is ready before PR merge. Technically, the CI check send operationsList HTTP request to Azure Resource Provider.

To fix this CI check failure, if you haven't got ARM signed off, pls get ARM signed off first then deploy ARM manifest. After deploying ARM manifest, this operationsList HTTP request will succeed and CI pass.

NOTE: If your RP is RPaaS RP, since RPaaS requires swagger merge first. In this case, you could ignore this CI check.


## Service API Readiness Test

This CI check is to test service API readiness, by running API Scenario test to verify:
- Service APIs are deployed to Azure
- API behavior is consistent with Swagger definition
- [InProgress] API behavior is compliant with Azure API guidelines, including [ARM RPC](https://github.com/Azure/azure-resource-manager-rpc) and [Microsoft Azure REST API Guidelines](https://github.com/microsoft/api-guidelines/blob/vNext/azure/Guidelines.md).

Note: Currently only applicable to management plane APIs, and target ARM region is `US West Central` - the SDP pilot region.

To fix the check, download the artifact `api_scenario_test_output` from Azure pipeline where you can find the report.html and auto generated API Scenario file as baseline, then refer to [API Scenario documentation](./api-scenario/readme.md) to run and debug it locally. After local debug, commit the API Scenario file and `readme.test.md` file into your working branch and then the CI check will use the committed API Scenario file to re-run the test.


## Cadl Validation

This validator is to ensure the cadl & swagger files in PR are consistent and the 'cadl' folder contains 'examples' and 'package.json'

### How to fix
| Error Code |Severity |Solution |
|---|---|---|
|MissingCadlFile| Error |Adding the related cadl project into {RP-Name} folder, like [Qumulo.Manaement](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/tree/main/specification/liftrqumulo/Qumulo.Management)|
|MissingExamplesDirectory| Error |The example files should be kept in the 'examples' folder under the cadl project,the cadl-autorest emitter will copy them into the output folder and create corresponding 'x-ms-examples' in the swagger automatically when geneates the swagger, you should also check in it in PR. See [cadl-autorest](https://github.com/Azure/cadl-azure/blob/main/packages/cadl-autorest/README.md#examples-directory)|
|InConsistentSwagger| Error |The generated swagger is inconsistent with the swagger in PR, so you need to re-generate swagger from cadl project and check in it. For how to generate swagger from cadl project, you can refer to [Complete Example and Generate OpenApi 2.0 spec](https://azure.github.io/cadl-azure/docs/getstarted/azure-resource-manager/step05)  |
|SwaggerNotExistInPR| Error |It occurs when there is a cadl file in the PR but the generated swagger is not present in the PR, so you need to add the swagger to the PR. For how to generate swagger from cadl project, you can refer to [Complete Example and Generate OpenApi 2.0 spec](https://azure.github.io/cadl-azure/docs/getstarted/azure-resource-manager/step05) |
|GeneratedSwaggerNotFound| Error | It occurs when there is a cadl file in the PR but there is no swagger produced by the cadl-autorest emitter, so you need to check the cadl-project.yaml to see if it has the wrong configuration,like 'output-dir' or 'azure-resource-provider-folder'. |
|MissingCadlProjectConfig| Warning |The configuration of '@azure-tools/cadl-autorest' including 'output-file','azure-resource-provider-folder' are used to customize the generated swagger file name and folder structure, it's recommended to use them in the 'cadl-project.yaml', here is a [sample cadl-project](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/blob/c91eca4e2081703002581da6f58f9d9332e1afd1/documentation/cadl-sample-project/specification/contosowidgetmanager/Contoso.WidgetManager/cadl-project.yaml#L15). |

## Traffic Validation

This validator generates traffic for all operations defined in Swagger files under default tag of readme.md by using [RESTler](https://github.com/microsoft/restler-fuzzer). Then, it validates the request and response pairs from the traffic against the corresponding Swagger definitions. Finally, it provides an html report that reports the Swagger accuracy.

### How to understand and improve the report
Please refer to [swagger-accuracy-report](./swagger-accuracy-report.md).

## Suppression Process

In case there are validation errors reported against your service that you believe do not apply, we have a suppression process you can follow to permanently remove these reported errors for your specs.  Refer to [Swagger Suppression Process](https://dev.azure.com/azure-sdk/internal/_wiki/wikis/internal.wiki/85/Swagger-Suppression-Process) for detailed guidance.
