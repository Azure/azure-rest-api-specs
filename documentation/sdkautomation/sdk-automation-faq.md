## How to Download the Generated Artifacts

### Prerequisites

Ensure the **spec-gen-sdk** CI check succeeds. If the check fails, the artifacts might not have been generated.

### Steps to Download Artifacts

Let's take Python as an example.

1. Navigate to `Checks` page: click on the **Checks** tab in the navigation pane of the pull request.

## .NET SDK Generation Error Fix Guidance

### How to Fix Naming Violations for Management Plane SDK

If your pipeline run logs already outline the naming violations, simply locate the reported issues and proceed as follows:

1. **Review the Pipeline Logs:**
   Identify the naming violations highlighted in the log output.

2. **Consult Naming Conventions:**
   Familiarize yourself with the [Naming Conventions](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/blob/main/doc/dev/Mgmt-Naming-Conventions.md) guidelines to understand the expected naming rules.

3. **Apply Polishing Configurations:**
   Use the [Polishing Configurations](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/blob/main/doc/dev/Mgmt-Polishing-Configurations.md) as a reference to adjust your SDK naming as per the conventions.

4. **Update and Validate:**
   Modify the specs to correct the naming issues and run the CI checks again to confirm that all violations have been resolved.
