# Glossary

This article defines some of the terms used in the articles under `documentation` directory.

## Grouping directory

A `grouping directory`, denoted as `<groupingDir>` in the [directory structure article], is a root folder for
a set of data-plane `service` folders. It is a subfolder of `data-plane` folder.

Each `service` in given `grouping directory` must [**version uniformly**][uniform versioning article] but each `service`
within a `grouping directory` can version independently of each other.

A `grouping directory` can be seen as a more free-form equivalent of the ARM `service group`, but for data-plane services.

Specifically, all services grouped in given `groping directory` do not share any ARM **Resource Provider (RP) namespace**
and are not related to ARM in any way.

## Resource type

In case of ARM, a `service` is a collection of `resource types` or `resource type groups`.

## Service

A `service` is a set of operation endpoints (typically HTTP REST API endpoints)
that [**version uniformly**][uniform versioning article].

A `service` corresponds to a cohesive, uniformly versioned experience for the customer with HTTP REST API surface,
documentation portal and language SDKs. For example, [Azure Kubernetes Service].

In this repository, an ARM service has a path of form:

`specification/<azureTeamName>/resource-manager/<RPNS>/<service>`

where `<RPNS>` stands for ARM **Resource Provider (RP) namespace**.

A data-plane service has a path of form:

`specification/<azureTeamName>/data-plane/<namespace>/<service>`

> [!NOTE]
> Some existing services follow different directory structure layouts.
> All such layouts are legacy, deprecated, and strongly discouraged going forward.

For example, [`specification/containerservice/resource-manager/Microsoft.ContainerService/aks`]
is a folder for the `aks` service within the `Microsoft.ContainerService` ARM Resource Provider namespace.

You can learn more about how a `service` maps to its directory in the [directory structure article].

## Service group

A `service group` is a set of services that share a common ARM **Resource Provider (RP) namespace**, `RPNS`.

Each `service` in given `service group` must [**version uniformly**][uniform versioning article] but each `service`
within a `service group` can version independently of each other.

A `service group` has a path of form:

`specification/<azureTeamName>/resource-manager/<RPNS>`

as such, it corresponds to ARM Resource Provider Namespace.

Example service group:

[`specification/containerservice/resource-manager/Microsoft.ContainerService`]

which is composed of two services, [`aks`] and [`fleet`].

> [!NOTE]
> Previously `service group` was erroneously used in reference to services like `aks`. This is incorrect.

You can learn more about how a `service group` maps to its directory in the [directory structure article].
